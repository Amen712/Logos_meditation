FOREWORD

 These lectures were delivered to the Westminster Bible School,
 stenographically reported, and are printed without material
 alteration.

The method is that of taking each Gospel in sequence and consider-ing
the parables and parabolic illustrations therein, but not repeating the
consideration, when these are repeated in other Gospels. Following the
rule, Mark has only one.

 ***I. The Parabolic Method***
A CONSIDERATION of the metaphorical or parabolic method of our Lord is necessary as a preliminary study, for there has been some misinterpretation of our Lord’s reason for His use of such method, There are two self-evident facts : first, that our Lord did use the parabolic method ; and secondly, that at a certain stage in His ministry
He employed it in a new way.

The fourth chapter of Mark’s Gospel opens with the statement that on that day Jesus went out of the house, and went into a boat, and He spoke “ many things in parables.” The thirty-third and thirty fourth verses declare, “ With many such l’arables spake He the word unto them . . . and without a parable spake He not unto them.” This means that He used parables constantly in what He said to the multitudes. In the course of these thirty-four verses there are two sections dealing with the reason of His parabolic method. The first is found in
verses ten to twelve. There He answered a question, and told the disciples the reason of His method. The second section is in verses twenty-one to twenty-five, again an explanation of His method.

In the first paragraph we have not a full explanation from our Lord, and that section demands the second paragraph. In the first explanatory paragraph we are faced with a difficulty, which we will state and
consider, and make certain deductions therefrom.

At this hour in the ministry of Jesus He specially adopted the parabolic method for addressing the crowds. He had used parabolic
illustrations before this time, notably to the woman of Samaria, when He spoke of the water of life ; to the disciples, when He told them
fields were white to harvest ; in Nazareth, when He spoke of the physician and his healing work ; to the disciples again, of fishers of
men ; and in His Manifesto, of salt and light and building. But the Sower was the first full parable, uttered at this time.

Tracing the course of our Lord’s ministry we shall find that there had come a moment when definite and positive hostility had hardened in a peculiar manner. In the home at Capemaum He had been challenged, because He had claimed to forgive sins. In the house of Levi He had been challenged because He permitted His disciples to omit fasting, and because He consorted with sinners. In the cornfields He had been criticized for allowing His disciples to pluck the ears of corn on the Sabbath. In a synagogue on a later Sabbath, He was challenged,
and they counselled to destroy Him. Again, in the house in Capernaum He was charged with being in complicity with the devil. All this had its definite effect upon the minds of the people. In the third chapter we
find it said, “ He looked round about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart.” That was the mental condition of the hour, of the rulers, which affected the crowds. This hardening of heart meant callousness, blindness, determination not to listen, nor to obey ; or if to listen, then only critically, and destructively.

At that time Jesus adopted this parabolic method when speaking to the multitudes. When their hardness of heart made Him angry, then
in a very definite and enlarged form He began to use parables ; His anger being the result of His grace, in the presence of their attitude.

The difficulty here is found in the tenth to twelfth verses. Much
has been said about it, and there have been differing interpretations.
The apparent meaning of the passage is that Jesus adopted the method
of the parable to prevent these people understanding, and to be
forgiven. That is the first impression made upon the mind as the verses
are read.

There have been two methods of dealing with that difficulty. The
first is that this is a truth which must be accepted though not understood.
Some Bible teachers and expositors take the view that our Lord
deliberately adopted the parabolic method here that the people should
not see, or understand, or be forgiven. The second method of dealing
with this passage is that the statement is not true, that He never
said it, and therefore the passage is untrustworthy. That second
method is impossible of belief by those who hold that the record is true.

But is the difficulty due to what the passage really says, or to longcontinued
interpretation, or misinterpretation of it ? Was the reason
of the parabolic method that men should be prevented from understanding,
and so be excluded from the mercy of God ? That would
surely be blasphemy, and would contradict the whole purpose of God
in Christ, and of Christ in the world. Consequently we must look at
this a little more particularly.

There is one important fact to bear in mind, that the narrative of
Mark is condensed ; and that of Luke is even more so at this point.
Matthew’s account is much fuller. In the thirteenth chapter of that
Gospel, after the parable of the sower, “ The disciples came, and said
unto Him, Why speakest Thou unto them in parables ? ” And He
answered, “ Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom
of heaven, but to them it is not given. For whosoever hath, to him shall
be given, and he shall have abundance ; but whosoever hath not, from
him shall be taken away even that which he hath. Therefore speak I
to them in parables ; because seeing they see not, and hearing they
hear not, neither do they understand.” Carefully notice the change.
“ Seeing they see not,” not that they may not see. “ Hearing they
hear not, neither do they understand.” They are seeing, but they do
not see. They are hearing, but they do not understand. Therefore
He spoke to them in parables.
Our Lord then quoted Isaiah, and Matthew writes, ‘, And unto
them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, By hearing ye
shall hear, and shall in no wise understand ; and seeing ye shall see,
and shall in no wise perceive.” Why ?
“ For this people’s heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of
hearing and their eyes have they closed ; lest haply . . .” Matthew
and Mark both use the word “ lest,” but the word needs a context
larger than Mark quoted. The ‘, lest ” is the “ lest ” of their attitude,
their hardness, of their persistence in unbelief. He was grieved with
their hardness of heart, and that was the reason why He adopted the
parabolic method. They had hardened their hearts until they had
become gross ; until they with seeing eyes were nevertheless blind.
That was their attitude. They had done this lest they should be
drawn back to God, and halted, and be forgiven. They were not
aware of that ultimate, but that was their condition.
Carry the thought a little further. According to Matthew, the
disciples had enquired the reason for speaking in parables. The Lord’s
answer was that it was given to them to know the mysteries. He told
His disciples that the difference in method was due to a difference in
relationship. To those of His disciples who were obedient, who submitted
to Him, the mysteries could be made known. To those without,
those not yielded, and not obedient, those refusing and hardening the
heart, the parabolic was the necessary method.
Go on to verses twenty-one to twenty-five in this fourth chapter of
Mark. He used the lamp as His illustration. This lamp is not put
under the bushel, which would extinguish it. It is put on a stand.
The parables therefore constituted a lamp, a lamp shining. It was
not in order to hide things, but that the hidden things might be brought
to light. These people could not, because of the attitude they had
assumed, receive the mysteries, the profound things of the Kingdom of
God. His disciples could receive those mysteries ; but to those
without, the parable was a lamp. There is nothing hidden except
that it may be manifested. There is nothing secret but that it may
be revealed. He gave them parabolic pictures, so that they might
enquire. The purpose of the story, the picture, was to lure them to
think, in order that they might find their way into the higher mystery.
Therefore it is important that the passage in Mark should be
interpreted by the fuller passage in Matthew. Take that matchless
triptych of stories constituting one great parable, recorded in the
fifteenth chapter of Luke, the lost sheep, the lost silver, and the lost
son. That was spoken to men who were blundering, and protesting
against Him. There is nothing in that story of the mysteries of the
Kingdom ; but it is there. Can we suppose Jesus told those men that
story of lost things sought, and found, in order to prevent their coming

to God, and finding mercy ? If they had heard that story, enquired
concerning it, sought its deep significance, they would have found
themselves in the presence of all the height and depth and length and
breadth of the mystery of the Kingdom of God.
In other words, the parable is ever the open door to the mystery.
If men will consider the picture, and enquire, He will always answer.
The parables therefore do but illustrate the whole fact of His approach
to the human heart.
There is a remarkable statement in the Proverbs.
“ It is the glory of God to conceal a thing ;
But the glory of kings is to search out a matter.”
That is true in Nature. God conceals behind that which is sacramental
that which is supreme, so that men may take the thing that is manifest,
and so following and enquiring, may find the deep secret. It is the
glory of God to conceal a thing, but it is the glory of kings to search
out a matter. The writer did not mean merely kings on the earthly
level, but the kingly nature, which is always seeking for the secret
thing.
The same philosophy is in the great word of Moses, uttered long
ago, “ The secret things belong unto the Lord our God ; but the things
that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever.” The
secret things are there that we may discover them. Nature is a great
parable. Think of the earth, and of research, the things man has
been finding out. They were all there from the beginning, but were
hidden.
With reverence let it be said that the Lord Himself and the whole
fact of the Incarnation is a parable. ” No man hath seen God at any
time, but the only begotten Son Which is in the bosom of the Father,
He hath declared Him.” The secret hidden, mysterious, of the Being
of Godhead. No man has seen that ; but as the old philosopher talking
to Job, said,
“ Canst thou by searching find out God ?
Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection ? ”
That is perfectly true, but God has revealed Himself, and supremely,
in His Son. The Son therefore becomes the picture, the parable, which
being known and investigated, God Himself is found.
Our Lord did not intend then in the use of the parable to prevent
men seeing, but to help them to see. He did not want to prevent
them hearing, but to quicken their power of hearing. He did not keep
men away from the forgiveness and the mercy of God, but He lured
them towards it. As we come to these wonderful illustrations, and
the more definite parables, we shall see He is not hiding, but veiling
“ The light that were else too bright,
For the feebleness of a sinner’s sight.”
If the truth can be suggested by the story, in the presence of that story

In the same connection, and to the same men, He used the figure

 of the mended garment and wine skins, in order to make His meaning

 plainer. He was illustrating the nature of His Kingdom. Briefly this

 is what He meant : He could not crowd into an outworn formula the

 new things He was teaching men. He had come, not to mend an old

 garment, but to make a new one. Therefore *new* methods were neces-

 and without harm to it. Wine, intended to ferment, would burst any

 old bottles would produce fermentation, which is always a sign of

 are wise, and wise when they are harmless. Any man going out upon the
 Master's business who lacks wisdom, is not harmless. Any man going out

 and, finally, that weird and wonderful illustration of an empty house,

 it, take those of the reed and a man in soft raiment. Simply and

 Jesus answered, and answered wonderfully, and when the messengers had
 been sent back, He used these illustrations in the presence of the
 crowds, two illustrations, and a direct word about the prophet.

 Look at the illustrations. In that listening crowd there were
 un-doubtedly those who would be impressed when they heard John's
 enquiry, and might be inclined to think of John as wavering. Some
 to-day say this was so, and that it was produced by his depression in
 the prison. I do not think so. John's enquiry meant rather that he did
 not understand the method of Jesus. However the crowd might

 tions can be made of it, but here He was showing the dishonesty of
 traditionalism, the dishonesty of these men of His own time who were
 traditionalists. In that same chapter when passing through the
 corn-fields, the question was raised, and now again when He healed a
 man on the Sabbath, Luke shows that it was on another Sabbath, but
 Matthew puts the two incidents close together. It was the Sabbath, and
 the traditionalists' attitude towards the Sabbath was marked by their
 question about the disciples, and the question of what Jesus would do

 age. Reformation without regeneration is no use. Oh, we may sweep the
 house, and garnish it, and improve certain conditions by creating a
 new environment but unless there is a new possessor, a new Lord, a new
 Master, instead of the old demon, the demons will return with
 sevenfold force. Reformation is ultimately of no value alone. It is
 only preparation for worse desolation. The only possible cure for a

 incoming of the new Lord and Master. That is so with the individual.

 the clouds with all the holy angels. There is a supernatural ending
 for the age, in which angels actually take part under His direction,
 in the affairs of men.

When He had finished His seven parables, He looked at that little

 possible for Christ to utter one more parable, showing their
 responsi-bilities about all these things, as scribes, instructed to
 the Kingdom of heaven.

 It was a great day when He began uttering parables : four to the
 crowds, and four to His own. The first four revealed the processes of
 the Kingdom through an age, on the human level. Three revealed the
 processes of the Kingdom from the Divine viewpoint, of the Divine
 purpose and standard ; and the final one showed the responsibility of
 His own in view of that view of the Kingdom.

 If any should believe that the whole world is to be converted and
 changed, and presently be transformed as the result of their work,
 they are blind. Christ is against such a belief, History is against
 it. The activities in the world to-day are against it. When we see
 this move-ment through this age from the Divine standpoint, then the
 heart is at rest as to the issue. The final parable here reveals the
 importance of the fact that we are scribes, instructed in the Kingdom
 of heaven. We must have the Master's conception if we are to serve the
 Kingdom without fret, without fever, without failing in quiet calm
 strength.

 instruction which they convey for us.

 We are next impressed by the fact that there are various conditions of
 the seed, and various responses of the soil. As our Lord explained His
 parable, when He referred to the seed, He did so by speaking of
 persons. These words of explanation are found, beginning at the
 nineteenth verse,

 " When any one heareth the word of the Kingdom, and understandeth it
 not, then cometh the evil one, and snatcheth away that which hath been
 sown in his heart. This is he that was sown by the wayside." Verse

In this narrative, taken as our Lord explained it, there may seem

 to be a difference, a disparity. Some may be inclined to say there is
 a

 contradiction between the incidence of the teaching in the story and

 that of the explanation. As a matter of fact, there is no difference

 or disparity. In the former, emphasis is laid upon the soil. In the

 latter, the emphasis *is* laid upon the nature of the seed that falls
 upon

 the soil. The seed sown, as we have seen, are men and women. But

 behind that sowing of human life in the world, with Kingdom intention,

 there is another sowing, that of the Word in the heart. Turning to

 Luke's account, there it is seen clearly that the sowing of the Word

 but do not understand, the soil is unreceptive. To men who hear,

 hear, but who respond to the age about them, the soil is destructive.

 The men who hear and understand in the full sense, to such the soil

 is receptive, productive, and constructive. Here in this first parable

Matthew **xiii: 31, 32**

 The explanation of the Sower was given in public. T HIS is the first
 of the octave of parables contained in this thirteenth chapter of
 Matthew, of which the Lord gave no explanation. That of the sowing of
 the darnel, was given in private to His disciples.

 When approaching such a parable, there are two perils to be One is

 be correct, but popularity ***is*** not any guarantee of accuracy.
 That needs no arguing. The acceptation of popular interpretation of
 Scripture led to the crucifixion of Jesus.

 Then there is a danger of considering history from the standpoint of
 observation, and interpreting these parables of Jesus by the facts of
 history as we know them. That too may be a perilous procedure against
 which we need to guard.

There are general principles of interpretation which must he

 observed. The first is that of the harmony of the teaching of Jesus
 throughout these parables. Referring now only to those parables
 contained in this thirteenth chapter of Matthew, we must bear in mind
 that there is perfect harmony in the general conception and teaching
 of Jesus throughout.

 In the second place, we must bear in mind the consistency of our He
 never used one in two different senses. Lord's figures of speech.

 They are all used consistently in the same way.

 To apply these canons of interpretation, the popular conception of
 this particular parable is that our Lord predicted the great success
 of the Kingdom. Almost invariably the parable of the mustard seed that
 became a tree is treated as though our Lord was showing the complete
 and ultimate success of the Kingdom in this age. We must not forget
 that all these parables have to do with one age.

 That view, however, has been distinctly disproved by history. There
 has been growth, but it has been unsatisfactory. We talk to-day of the
 Kingdom of God, and of Christian nations. There are no Christian
 nations. There are nations that profess to be founded upon Christian
 principles, but there are no Christian nations.\
 We are not a Christian nation. The principles of a Christian nation
 have never yet been put to the test, and proven, and revealed to the
 world in national life. There has been a growth in Kingdom
 understanding, and the application of Kingdom principles, but nothing
 approaching complete On the contrary, there is very much that denies
 success. success.

 Another principle to be observed is that of the harmony of teaching.
 Throughout all these parables these things of difficulty, limitation,
 opposition, and admixture were evidently foretold by our Lord. There
 is not one parable that moves to a consummation of the age resulting
 from the activities in the age. The idea that the Gospel is to be
 preached until all the world is converted, is a mistaken one, if we
 believe in Jesus, and in what He said. There is nothing that suggests

 Who sowed the seed is the Son of man. The soil, the field in which the
 seed is sown, is the world. The birds are symbolic of evil, that come
 and snatch away the seed. These figures are consistent.

 Let us then look at this parable with unprejudiced and open mind. So
 we will examine the picture, and apply the teaching.

 The picture Jesus drew was of a seed, the smallest of all seeds, which
 seed grew until it became a tree. Normally the mustard seed never
 becomes a tree. The mustard is a herb, not a tree. As a tree it has
 been described as " a garden shrub outdoing itself." That is
 abnormality. All attempts to make the tree square with popular
 interpretation is of the nature of special pleading. I have referred
 to

 THE MUSTARD SEED 49

 Said Christ, That seed will be sown by the Sower, but only a portion
 will be fruitful. There will be the scattering of seed that bears no
 fruit. He suffered no delusion. He did not say that the seed being
 planted, a complete and perfect harvest would result. He saw an enemy
 scattering amid the seed, damel. He saw that the age must run on with
 the development of wheat and darnel, until the con- So here He saw the
 growth, out of life, but summation of the age.

 abnormal. A herb becomes a great tree, and the fowls of the air lodge
 in its branches.

 What is the bearing of this parable on us ? It calls us to a
 recogni-tion of the facts of the age in which we live. That will save
 us from the delusion that so often fills the minds of honest souls
 with despair. We thought it would have been so different, that the
 Kingdom principles were winning. We thought that was so, with a
 certain measure of arrogance, at the close of the nineteenth century
 and on into the twentieth. Then like the crack of doom we found the
 Kingdom ideal rejected by the philosophers of earth, and the earth
 bathed in blood, and muck, and war. With reverence again I say, Christ
 had no such delusions.

 ***I I. The Leavened Meal***\
 T

 " Three measures of meal." When Jesus said that, He was not using
 occasional language, but employing a phrase that had a definite
 meaning and value to those who heard it. It is often very valuable to
 find where the phrase first occurs in the Bible, and then to trace it
 through. To do that in the case of these words, we shall find it used
 in Genesis, before the time of Moses, before the law was given. I t
 occurs in the eighteenth chapter of Genesis, in a wonderful picture.

 work of an enemy sowing darnel, imitations of the good seed. He had
 shown then how during this period there would be unnatural
 develop-ment of a mustard seed to a great tree. Finally He had shown
 how during the age there would be a process of degeneration in the
 Kingdom under the figure of the leavened meal.\
 Look back over the age from the word of our Lord while here until this
 time, and it will be seen how all the things that He foretold have

 Do not forget, although the price was paid, although it was as great
 as that, He procured the world. He bought the field. It became His
 property. It is His property now.

 traditional views in interpretation. It does not follow that what is
 popular is wrong, or that what is traditional is false. However it may
 be so in both cases.

 the one who seeks, and purchases, and possesses his Lord. Indeed, that
 interpretation has found expression in a hymn, not often heard now.

 Jesus. He spoke many things in parables, and when He had finished His
 teaching, He departed.

 This Iast parable is not concerned with the history of the Kingdom in
 the age, but with the responsibility of His disciples during that
 period. The parable in itself is very brief, and yet full of revealing
 suggestiveness. It followed a question and an answer. That question
 and answer must be borne in mind. The question was one which our Lord
 asked of these men who had listened to Him, and the answer was their
 reply.

 they were quite honest in their answer, but I do not think they had

That preliminary setting of the revealing parable marks the method

 of treatment. First of all note the preliminary requirement as

 put upon the teaching of religion a false conception and outlook, and

 There can be nothing more important than that teaching in the name of

 So, having rebuked the seekers after a sign, and revealed the reason
 of their failure, that they were blind because evil, and evil because
 unfaithful to God, He warned His disciples against their teaching,

 What we celebrate and call Palm Sunday, and speak of as the triumphal

 separate days. Mark tells the story of His first coming. It was on a

 about upon all things, and said nothing. He turned His back, and

 went out. On the next day, our Sunday, the first day of the week in

 the Jewish calendar, He came again, and cleansed the Temple. When

 He first entered the traffickers were not there. It was the Sabbath.

 They had taken their places again on the next day, when He cleansed

 the Temple. Then on the Monday, their second day of the week, He

 came again, and that was the great and dramatic day of controversy

 with the rulers. That word is used with care and determination. It

 was a dramatic day. There is nothing in the life of our Lord
 comparable

 to it in certain respects. It was a day in which He, though rejected
 by

 the rulers, chief priests, scribes, and Pharisees, nevertheless
 entered

 the city and the Temple, gathered those men about Him, and compelled

 them to find verdicts on their own condition, and pass sentences on

 their own failure. That is a summary of events, details of which we

 come to in the parabolic illustrations. In these days this cursing of

 the fig-tree occurred, which was unquestionably a parabolic act, and

 concerning which our Lord gave an interpretation. The whole para-

 graph must be taken in its entirety, against its background, to under-

 stand the things I have referred to as existing.

 that story of the threefold entry, we shall find He entered in every

 aspect of authority. He entered as the King, as Prophet, as Priest.

 All through the story we see the august and splendid and glorious

 dignity of Jesus. Oh, yes, His enemies were there in their robes and

 is almost amused at the way some people seem to be puzzled. The

 rank and file seem to understand it better than the expositors. Going

 over expository literature it is interesting to find what difficulty
 has

 been created. We must bear in mind this is the only miracle of judg-

 ment that Jesus wrought. We may say, What about the destruction

 of the swine, when they swept down the steep place into the sea?

But when Jesus came to this fig-tree, He found nothing but leaves.

 There should have been no leaves at all. It was a false development,

 so there were leaves, but no fruit. It was a tree of false
 development.

 The leaves suggested its fruitfulness, but no fruit was there. There

 the tree grew by the wayside as they travelled along. Jesus, being

 hungry, came up to it, and looked at it. Leaves were on the tree

 matter, but it is important. The disciples were not surprised at the

 effect produced upon that tree. They were surprised at the quickness,

Again we are told that the action of destroying that tree was not

 according to the methods of Jesus. Let us think again before we say

 that. So many people have the idea that our Lord is known only as

 the meek and lowly Jesus. He was meek. He said so. He was lowly.

 He claimed to be so. But He was infinitely more. He was majestic

 with a majesty that appals us the nearer we get to Him, and His

 wrath was terrific when it blazed forth in words that at the distance

 of nearly two millenniums scorch us as we read them. We remember

coming, the day of vengeance.

 Jesus to Jerusalem. He had entered the city as the King, and had

 had entered as Priest, and cleansed the Temple, for a brief period
 restoring it to its true place in the economy of God. He now came as
 the great Prophet, with the message of God, and this time the message
 was judicial. That was His purpose in coming.

 These things should be stressed, because we need to be delivered from
 any false thinking about the final things in the life of our Lord. We
 might be apt to think, and perhaps naturally, of Him as being hemmed
 in by His enemies, caught, and by them put to death. That Never in all
 human history is an entirely false view of the situation.

 was anyone less hemmed in by His enemies than was Jesus.

 The story beginning in this passage is a remarkable revelation of
 this. In all literature there is no more dramatic passage than this.
 From the standpoint of the watching angels, and heaven's observation,
 we see a most amazing thing. He is seen coming up, gathering round
 about Him the rulers who had utterly failed in the economy of God ;
 and compelling them to find a verdict upon their own conduct, and to
 pass a sentence commensurate with the verdict they themselves had
 found. He did this by the simple method of telling them stories, and
 asking their opinion on them.

 their opinion, and the opinion they gave was perfectly accurate. Then
 He told them another story, and again He asked their opinion, and they
 gave it, and it was quite correct. Thus, with a master hand, and by
 the use of simple illustrations of parabolic nature, He reached down
 into the deepest things in the lives of these men, and they pleaded
 guilty, and chose their own punishment, without knowing what they were
 doing, until He had finished. Then they saw He was speaking about
 them.

 There are two parables here, that of the two sons, and that of the

 That was the challenge of the rulers. Their opposition to Him

 in a very fruitful hill." They all knew that song of Isaiah. They were

 all familiar with that writing, and Jesus based His two parables upon

 that old-time song, and that in a remarkable way.

 Take the first parable. The story told to them was that of two

 sons, and their opinion was asked concerning it. The story of the

 two sons, carefully considered, is seen to be the condemnation of

 their methods. The second parable, that of the husbandmen, is a

 condemnation of their motives.

 The figure employed is that of two sons, both receiving a com-

 mand to work in the vineyard. One said, I will not go, but afterward

 he repented, and went. The other said, as we render it, " I go, Sir."

 There is no word " go " there in the Greek. It would be awkward with-

 out it, but really it is an emphatic " I." " I, Sir." The picture
 Jesus

 drew was that of two sons in front of the master of the vineyard, and

 he said to the one, Go and work in my vineyard, and he said, I will

 not go; to the other he said the same thing, and the other said,

 TWO SONS AND HUSBANDMEN I I I

 **112** PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD

 When they had found their verdict, and passed that sentence, He passed
 His sentence. That is found in verse forty-three. He first quoted to
 them the Scripture about the rejected Stone being the Head of the
 corner. He pronounced the sentence of utter and absolute ex-

 argument of any avail. If they were not prepared to be honest enough
 to face the fact that the baptism of John was from heaven, and
 con-sequently his identification of Jesus proved the authority of
 Jesus, there was nothing else to be said to them. To men who were not
 honest, there was no argument of any avail, and those who refused the
 evidences that were so simple and patent and clear were rejected.

 As Jesus told these stories to those rulers, and they found out what
 He was doing, their anger was stirred to yet greater depths. We learn
 therefore that ancient privilege is always unavailing when it departs
 from immediate and present responsibility. The King's new teaching
 here was a return to fundamental intentions, and He showed how the
 rulers of the people had failed, and declared that there should be
 another nation that would not fail, but would bring forth the fruits
 of justice and righteousness, for which God is ever seeking in His
 vineyard.

***23. The Marriage Feast***

 **H E R E** is an intimate connection between the forty-third verse in
 the previous chapter, and this parable. That verse read, "The Kingdom
 of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation
 bringing forth the fruits thereof." This chapter begins,

 This chapter begins in a strange and arresting way. It says,

 the Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He spake of
 them. And when they sought to lay hold on Him, they feared the
 multitudes, because they took Him for a prophet. And Jesus
 answered,"that is, He answered their attitude, answered the question
 in their minds, which had now become a conviction, perhaps suddenly
 and startlingly so.

 Our Lord had spoken the two parables of the sons and of the vine-

 These were the final days in the life of our Lord on earth, and these
 parables all move in that realm. On this third day, He was there in
 the Temple as the great Prophet of God, the King, and Prophet, dealing
 with the nation in august majesty and dignity. The two parables we
 have considered had dealt with responsibility. Now He In the former
 two gave them a parable which dealt with privilege.

 parables, labourers were in view, and the vineyard was the back- 8

 ground. Now guests are in view, and the background is a marriage

 feast. In the former, two commandments were laid upon men to

 fulfil obligations. In this, an invitation is offered to men to accept

 hospitality. So there is that difference between this parable and the

 two former, though they are all linked together.

 glancing at the whole of these fourteen verses, we see their
 structure.

 The parable He now uttered was, in a remarkable way, predictive.

 He was looking over the whole fact of His own ministry, to the
 ministry

 of His servants that should follow to the end of the age. That is

 clearly seen if we study this carefully. Three invitations are
 offered.

 The marriage feast is in the background, to which men are asked, but

 there are three distinct invitations.

 The account of the first invitation is in verses two and three. The

 call was given, and those invited would not come. In the second

 invitation (four to seven) the call is renewed, and we have the
 response

 of indifference and hostility. Then the third invitation, commencing,

The first was that of His own mission. The second referred to

 His mission as it would be carried on by His servants, and that ended

 with judgment and the destruction of the city, a literal prediction of

 what happened a generation after, when Jerusalem was destroyed.

 The third invitation applied to the period from the destruction of

 Jerusalem to the consummation of the age in which we are now

 living.

If we apply this parable in detail, this first section has no applica-

 tion to us now, save as we look back and learn from what happened.

 The second section also has no application to us, except as we watch

 and see what happened. But we are living in the third section, and

 our responsibility is revealed in that part of the parable. The first

 invitation was the call that had already been given, in the ministry

 of Jesus. The second invitation was the call which was repeated by

 His servants, from the time of His death to the destruction of the

 city. The third began when He sent out no longer to them that

 were bidden, but into the highways and byways, that all might be

 called in. There is perspective in this parable, and in that sense it
 is

 distinctly predictive.

 it falls into three distinct parts. The first part was addressed to
 the multitudes and His disciples. Notice the opening words of the
 chapter. He was still there in Temple precincts. The crowds were all
 round about Him. Nearest to Him were His own disciples, and in the
 first twelve verses He addressed Himself to the disciples and to the
 crowds. As we read, it is easy to see the part intended for the
 multitudes, and the particular part intended for His own disciples.

 Beginning at the thirteenth verse, still in the same situation, the
 disciples and the multitudes still there, and the rulers with whom He
 had dealt in the earlier chapter ; He began to address Himself
 directly to those rulers, and those in authority. That section
 beginning at verse thirteen ends at verse thirty-six.

 The third section was addressed, out of His heart, to the city of

 There were multitudes of Jerusalem folk gathered in the Temple, and
 unquestionably others. There was the city of Jerusalem itself, built
 round about that Temple, and He addressed Himself to the city as the
 mother of the nation. That is in verses thirty-seven to thirty-nine.

 the real presence of the living Lord. Yet in historic sequence this is
 the period of His absence. He was in the world for one brief
 generation of a little more than three and thirty years, the great
 period in human history to which everything else led up, and from
 which everything else of value had proceeded, and is proceeding, and
 will proceed. No one who believes in the New Testament But He is

 can deny that. The statement is clear that He Who came is coming again
 to the world. All through this Olivet prophecy our Lord was looking at
 the world, and His Church from that standpoint of their being in the
 world, when He, as to bodiIy presence, was absent, going into a far
 country, and after a long time, coming again.

 This parable must not be confused with that of the Pounds in Luke's
 Gospel. The emphasis in the two parables is entirely different. What
 then was the figure used here ? One characterized by the utter-most
 simplicity. The fourteenth verse opens, " For it is as when a man,
 going into another country." In the Revised Version the words

 with the one had a wrong estimate of his master, which was entirely
 false, as an excuse for inactivity. He took his talent and hid it in a
 napkin and buried it, and he said he did it because his lord was hard
 and unjust, reaping where he did not sow. Inactivity ! One talent
 committed to him. If he had traded with it, and that talent had
 produced one, then it would have been as good as the man with the two,
 or the man with the five talents. It would have been one hundred per
 cent. But this man had done nothing with his lord's possession.
 Nothing was brought to the Iord by the use of his talent.

 The issue is perfectly simple and plain. Notice carefully two verses.

 as He enforced His claims all the way, they consisted of His claims

 upon the earth. Thai prayer which we designate the Lord's prayer

 moved on two realms. The first had to do with man's relationship to

 God, and the second, man's necessities on the earth level, and man's

 interrelationship on the earth. He taught His disciples to pray, " Our

 Father, which art in the heaven, Thy name be hallowed, Thy Kingdom

 come, Thy will be done on earth as in heaven." The passion of that

 prayer does not ask that men may find their way to heaven one day,

 but that God may win the earth, and that the earth may find itself

 in the Kingdom of God. The earth is in view.

*29. The Growth of the Seed*

 I

 I do not know, but one does wonder, especially because of its
 remark-able value, a value that no other parable had which Jesus
 uttered concerning the Kingdom. It assumes the teaching of the other
 parables, and so is arresting that Mark has recorded it. Perhaps it
 specially impressed Mark because of his own character. His was an
 interesting personality. Paul and Barnabas had a difference of opinion
 concerning

 **TO**

 him, so definite a quarrel that they parted company. Paul may have
 been right that Mar-k was vacillating, that when he went back at
 Pamphylia, there was some element of weakness in his character. To

 possibly be said, except that we pause to notice the similarity of the
 basic ideas in this group of parables. In every one of them is the
 seed containing potentialities, but needing to be sown. In every one
 we have growth, development, consequent upon sowing, and in every one
 there is harvest, the result of the development, consequent upon the
 sowing.

 The central matter in this little parable is that of growth. Sowing is
 recognized. Harvest is also recognized, but the teaching concerns the
 process between the sowing and the harvest. If we have all those
 parables in mind, and remember how our Lord had likened the Kingdom
 under these changing and yet similar figures of speech, we are
 prepared to approach this. Following our method, let us look at the
 figure which our Lord here employed.

 It is a perfectly natural one, and therefore absolutely necessary. A
 man sows seed. Notice how our Lord says this. " So is the Kingdom

 and then he goes on with his ordinary life. Quite properly he goes to

 sleep at night, and rises in the morning. He carries on.

Meanwhile, what he has done in sowing the seed, is being carried

 has done something. He has sown the seed, but there is no more he

 goes to sleep, and he rises, in night and day, but there is no
 cessation

 in the activity resulting from what he has done, though he is not now

 acting. The result of what he has done is that the seed is springing,

 growing, developing, and it is coming quietly, first the blade, then
 the

 ear, and then the full corn in the ear. There are certain laws and

 forces inherent in the seed and in the soil. In the seed is a
 principle

 of life. That principle is in every seed. There are forces of life in

 the soil, and these forces of life in the soil, in co-operation with
 the

 forces of life in the seed, produce a result, and produce it quietly ;
 and

 presently, " first the blade, then the ear," and then the full growth.

 Take the whole, and see a wonderful co-operation between man

 and Nature. Nature cannot sow, and it cannot reap. Man cannot

 give the increase. The figure is everything in this parable. It
 carries

 its own lesson. The marvellous forcefulness of this grips us. In the

 first great parable, the sower went forth to sow. Whereas the one
 Sower

 was the Lord Himself, He is not the Sower here, because the figure

 says that the man does not know how the growth is going on. He

 cannot help it, and cannot do anything about it. That is not true of

 the Lord. It is true of us, and of everyone called into co-operation
 with

 Him in sowing seed. We know what the seed is. We have had the

 figure in other parables. The seed is the Word.

 We have a wonderful figure here. We need not go to the East for

 this. We can look at it in our own land anywhere. A man goes forth

 to sow, and when he has done his sowing there is no more he can do.

 He must wait, but there is no cessation of activity. There is an
 activity

 resulting from his sowing. The seed he sows has fallen upon the soil,

 and the earth brings forth fruit of itself. Then presently,

THE GROWTH OF THE SEED

 ways we can help. All that is preparatory to the one thing, the
 scatter-

 ing of the seed. We can hinder. Man can even in his folly trample

 upon the blade as it appears, and crush it out ere it have time to

 develop. All that is admitted. Interference may be destructive, but

 man cannot produce a harvest. Man cannot produce a harvest even

 by the sowing of the Word of God. In a sense his very sowing is pre-

 paring for harvest, but all this is an unveiling of the necessity for

 standing still, and being patient. The co-operation of life forces
 outside

 seeds, and in a week or two we were digging them up to see how they

 were getting on ! We are very much given to digging up what we

 have planted, instead of resting content to scatter the seed, and
 leave

 it to the forces of God to bring in the harvest.

 And yet there is a necessity for reaping. When the full harvest

 is there, when the manifestation is there that the sowing of the seed

 has produced this process of development, the blade and ear and full

 corn, then the harvest. In that sense we may take this parable and

 apply it as to the Sower, as to the Lord Himself, although primarily

 it was intended for those working for Him. He has patience, and

 waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and how patient He is. But

 the harvest will come. Then His sickle will be put in.

 I am more concerned with the application of the parable to our-

 nothing to pay, not one of us. In the words of our hymnology,

 often sung,

 Why not ? We have nothing to bring. We have nothing with which

 we can pay the debt we owe to God, consequent upon a violated law,

 and sin in our lives, whether of the spirit or the flesh, matters
 nothing.

 This parable, sharp-cut as a cameo as we ponder it, brings us face to

 face with the fact that the sentence on every one of us morally is
 that

 we have nothing to pay, nothing sufficient to meet our obligations.

 Then if that is the great central truth, by implication there is

 another amazing thing. There is forgiveness for all. He forgave them

 both. Behind that there is so much that cannot be said, but must be

 remembered. I do not know who this money-lender was, but even the

 ever act at the expense of holiness. That is where the Cross came in.

 It was the means by which He made possible the forgiveness of God,

 granted to both of them, the fifty and the five hundred sinner, what-

 ever the degree of guilt might have been.

 Then we glance at the direct teaching. He teaches that moral

 cleansing is the inspiration of devotion, that love is not a mere
 passing

 human emotion. It is a great devotion, and it springs out of moral

 a sense of bondage. It restores spiritual perception, and is of such a

 nature that such a woman will violate her own inclination or pre-

 judice. Nothing else would have persuaded her to go into that man's

 house, but she went in. Luke is careful to tell us that when she knew

 He was in the house, that brought her in. She trampled on all her

 told to answer that question. The lawyer was one whose official

 business it was to interpret law. He was of the order of lawyers, or

 scribes. Those are synonymous terms. His whole business in life

 was that of showing the relation of law to life. In those times, if
 men

 had a difficulty, they consulted a scribe, a lawyer, to know what the

 law said on this matter of behaviour in life. This was the man who

 came to Jesus. He said, Give me a law that will so condition life that

THE GOOD SAMARITAN

Glance at the picture, and do not forget that our Lord was show-

 ing this man what the responsibility was, created by the law which

 conditions life, in order that life may be full. He was illustrating

 responsibility. Look at the road. Luke is careful as he says it was a

 road " going down from Jerusalem to Jericho," a geographical accuracy.

 The road did go down. The boundaries are there, Jerusalem and

 Jericho. Jerusalem, the city of history and religion, the great centre
 of

 privilege. Jericho, beautiful in situation, a city of palm trees, but
 a

 city that had been under a curse of God for centuries. The book of

 Joshua tells us this. Strangely enough by this time Jericho had become

 a priestly city where priests dwelt when not fulfilling their courses
 in

 Jerusalem. The road lying between these two cities was a rocky and

 dangerous gorge, a pathway haunted at the time by marauding Beda-

 this man had no dealings whatever with Jews. We are told Jews had no
 dealings with the Samaritans, and the other thing is equally true, the
 Samaritans had no dealings with the Jews. This man, travelling along,

 It has been affirmed, and I agree with the general statement, that
 Jesus never did pray with His disciples as though He were on a level
 with them. He always prayed alone. It is certainly well to remember
 that the word employed for His praying was never the word that It was

 disciples had watched Him praying, and when He had ceased, one of
 them, unquestionably affected by what he had seen, and perhaps heard,
 asked, " Lord, teach us to pray." Then there was a flashing side-light
 upon John, " even as John also taught his disciples." There It is is a

 quite evident he had devoted himself to the prayer-life, and he had

 taken time with those disciples of his early and mighty ministry to

 teach them to pray. Yet these men saw in Jesus something different.

 in two ways. He first gave them a model of prayer with which we are

 all familiar, an abbreviated model, but a full one in another way.

 Then He turned to the illustrations of the friend at midnight, and

 of the father and his child.

 First there came the model. He began by saying, "When ye pray,

 say, Father." Everything is there. We must keep that in mind when

 pray, say, Father."

Having given this abbreviated model of prayer He then proceeded

 to His illustrations. The first moved in the realm of human
 friendship.

 Notice the recurrence of that word friend. It is an account of friend-

 ship. A request was preferred by a friend to a friend, on behalf of a

 friend. A man had come to call on him at midnight-a very awkward

 hour it may be admitted at once-and he had nothing to set before

 him. He had a friend in some dwelling nearby, and so he made his

 way to the house of his friend, to ask him for help for this other

 friend. The awkwardness of the hour may be some excuse for the

 action of the man in bed with his children. Notice what he objected

 to. He objected to being troubled. Keep the emphasis there.

 Therefore on the basis of friendship he made a refusal. The house

 was locked up, he was in bed, and did not want to be troubled. That

 is the story.

 But evidently this man who went for a loaf meant to get it. He

 kept on. Said Jesus, This man would not be troubled on the basis of

 friendship, but was disturbed, and so rose and acted because of the

 importunity of the man who was asking. That is the word. That word

 importunity is very interesting. It is the only place in the Greek New

 which means troublesome. Because the man was importunate enough,

 this man who would not be troubled on the basis of friendship, was

 troubled in another way, by impudence. What for ? To make the

 troubling cease. He only gave him the loaf to get rid of him, to save

 himself further trouble. He who would not be troubled on the basis

 of friendship, got up and found the loaf and gave it to the man, so

 that he went back home with something for his friend. That is our

 a rude one. The man was evidently not thinking about what Jesus was

 Jesus at this point ; indeed the request was quite alien from it. If
 this man had been listening to His teaching, and had accepted it in
 any sense, he would not have spoken. There was a fretting and fuming
 against the wrong as he spoke, and perhaps on the human level it was a
 wrong. At any rate he appealed to Jesus to bid his brother to divide
 the inheritance with him.

 seeking to know if our Lord's teaching was intended to lay responsi-

 bility on the apostles, and those who should be called after them to

 certain definite spiritual authority within the Church of God, or

 whether it applied to all the Church. That is the background of the

 parable.

 Notice how our Lord answered it. He did so by asking a question

 which, in a sense, He did not answer at all. Peter said, Who is that

 The picture our Lord here drew was of a household, which we

 must interpret by the East. There the household is a very different

 thing to what it is here. The household was composed of a lord, a

master, the supreme one over all those who constituted the house-

hold, a despot not in any bad sense, but in a good sense, signifying

complete and unquestioned and unqualified authority. Then in the

household there was the office of stewardship, those under the lord

 who were the representatives of the lord. They were stewards of the

 property of their lord. A steward not only had charge of these things,

 he was responsible for their administration in the household. In the

 households who were in special positions of government and authority

 over the affairs. That is the picture.

 What were the possibilities lying within that fact of stewardship in

 the part of stewards within the household are suggested. The lord is

 absent, he is not there. There may be those who postpone his return,

 ill-treat them, and give themselves to carousing. That is infidelity.

 The Lord's teaching is that presently when the lord comes himself,

 he will deal with these stewards. He will deal with those who have

 been faithful, and set them in authority over all other things ;
 associat-

 ing himself completely with them in dominion. With those unfaithful,

 illustrate. The figures of the fig-tree and the vineyard were
 prominent nationally at that time. One might be familiar with the song
 of the vineyard in the fifth chapter of the prophecy of Isaiah,
 without realizing that this parable as to method is closely connected
 with it. There is no doubt that in the mind of our Lord thoughts of
 Isaiah's song are to be found, and that His parable in certain ways
 was an adaptation of that song of Isaiah.

 This parable might be applied to the nation of Israel, and to God's
 dealing with that people. While not denying that there may be such an
 application, unquestionably there is that implication; if that be all,
 we do not really understand at what our Lord was aiming. So

 were people who came to tell Him something that Pilate had done. He
 had mingled the blood of some Galileans with the sacrifices they had
 offered. The Galileans were a hot-headed crowd, and were often in some
 political difficulty, and it is quite evident there had been some
 trouble. At the time perhaps some religious festival was going for-

 slaying of those people as though they perished. That is not the
 deepest meaning of perishing. They were slain by Pilate, but they

 about human life, whether individually or nationally. Keeping here to
 the individual application, He gave parabolic illustration of the
 truth concerning human life, as against the foolish superstition in
 their minds of which they had given evidence, as they reported this
 story about Pilate and the Galileans.

*38. The Parable of Lost Things*

 T

 This is one parable, with three pictures. Luke uses the expression

 at the beginning, " He spake unto them this parable." There are

 stages in the pictures, but there is no break in the parable itself.
 First,

 scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with

 them." He let them come near Him. He did not stand aloof. Indeed,

 He went so far as to sit down and eat with them. The scribes were

 the appointed moral teachers and interpreters of the law ; and the

 Pharisees were the great ritualists and supernaturalists in the realm

 of religion. Both these criticized Him. The crowds, held in contempt

 by the rulers, were getting near Him, and He was receiving them.

 The Pharisees and scribes were standing aloof, critical, uttering
 words

 of condemnation. We discover then, unquestionably, the subject which

 our Lord wished to illustrate. He was first declaring the meaning and

 reason of His receiving sinners. That is what the Pharisees and
 scribes

 objected to. He received them, and the word is a very strong one. He

 received them to Himself. He took them into close comradeship, and

 sat down, and had close fellowship with them, and He ate with them.

 He was trying to show these critical rulers why He received sinners

 and ate with them. He was interpreting to them the actions they were

 no reason being given, had wandered and was lost. He declared that

 any true shepherd, if he had lost one sheep, would leave the ninety

 first

 time He had employed the figure of the shepherd. That, however, is

 the first phase of this parable.

 Churches to-day who are lost at home through the carelessness of
 others.

 They are still somewhere about, but they have no purchasing power,

 and they are making no contribution that is worth while to the great

 cause. They are lost through the carelessness of others.

*When we* turn to the picture of the first son, we have a very

 plenty, and yet find a famine. He joined himself to a citizen of that

 to himself, when substance is gone, and friends are gone, and the

 possibility of finding food is gone. There is nothing left. He came to

 himself, and that is when reason dawned again. He began to think.

 He was lost. That is Christ's outlook. He was lost through his own

 deliberate choice and pride.

 Yet there is another picture there. Another son is out in the fields

 of what he is doing. He hears the sound of music and dancing, and

 called the other man his brother, but He never called him the other

 man's brother. It is a slight matter, but worth noticing. He was lost.

 He did not know his father. He did not know his father's heart.

 He was lost in his father's country ; duteous, and a man can be lost

 there, as well as everywhere else. The lost sheep-a stupid thing.

 of a father to meet his boy. That is God.

Nor how dark was the night that the Lord passed through,

E'er He found the sheep that was lost."

 That is God. The search within the dwelling is God seeking by His

 Spirit. The woman is the instrument, but the inspiration is Divine.

 Then we see the picture of God in the father, welcoming the boy.

 It is wonderful to see that when the boy got back, he found that which

 he had left home to find in the far country, and had not found there.

The question arises as we approach this story, was this a parable,

 perhaps those listening to Him, had seen. I do not dogmatize, but that

 position applies equally to the story of the unrighteous steward,

 we have considered. Jesus began then in exactly the same way,

 sider quite simply the figure He employed, and from those two things

 attempt to deduce the special teaching.

 In reading this story there are two perils we must avoid. We have

 no right to leave anything out of the story that is in it. Secondly we

 have no right to read into it anything which is not found therein.

 These two principles are vital. Some have been dogmatic on the ques-

 tion of duration, which may be suggested. There is nothing here to

 warrant any such position. Going as far as our Lord has gone, we

 but with ribald mockery they laughed at Him, mocked Him, at the

 idea of the relation between material and spiritual wealth. That led

 to this story, though not immediately, for in the verses preceding the

 nineteenth, we find that He unmasked their motive and their method,

 unmasking the reason why they laughed at His interpretation of the

 relative values between material wealth and spiritual, between mammon
 and the fear of God ; and the reason was as He said, that they lived
 in the sight of men, instead of in the sight of God.

 Then continuing, He showed how they were unfaithful in much, in great
 things, and consequently they were not to be trusted in the very
 little. Again there is the contrast between the spiritual and the

 Take the story quite simply. Jesus drew a contrast between two men
 living on earth, on two entirely different levels. The one was
 wealthy, living in luxury and ostentation. It is significant that
 there is not a thing against this rich man, measuring him by the
 standards of time. We are not told that he was vulgar, though he was
 terribly so, as every man is who is living only on the level of the
 dust. No court of law in England would have put this man on trial. The
 things we usually classify as vulgar sins are not in sight. There is
 no sugges-tion that he was living a depraved life, but he was rich.
 That was not wrong. He was clothed in purple. and fine linen. Those

 table. Possibly he was, but certainly the rich man knew nothing about
 it,

 or if he did and suffered it, there was no credit to him. When we
 allow

 What about the other man ? There is no more poignant picture of

 abject poverty than that man, living in hunger, evidently lacking the

 necessities of life, and the nourishment of the body, so that he was
 full

 of sores. We are not told how he came to be there. There is no dealing

 with social conditions. They were there, or that man had never been

 in that position. There is no blame attached to circumstances and

 environment, and none is suggested as attaching to the man. As a

 matter of fact, the issue, when he crossed over, proves he was a godly

 man, that he believed in the God of Abraham. Poor, weak, so far

 down, that the rough pariah dogs had pity on him, and with healing

 salve, licked his sores. There is no contrast more remarkable than

 that of two men on the earth level.

But our Lord had not finished His story, and those two men had

 living was over. It was left, the purple and the fine linen, to the
 moths, and the wealth to quarrelling relatives, if we are to believe
 humanity is the same, and it is. He went out into eternity a pauper,
 and a pauper stripped. The little **left, he lost the much that was

 crossing over was drawn near to the much, near to the spiritual, near
 to the eternal, near to the heart of the God of law, Who is the God of

 was the result of the method of life here.

 grain of mustard seed. He detected that, lying behind their request

 for an increase of faith which should enable them to fulfil the
 severity

 and sternness of His demands, was a hope that if they could gain this

 power, some increase of faith, there would be some reward following

 it, there would be some virtue in it, some benefit, following such an

 attainment that would come to them. This He knew, so His reply in

 parabolic illustration and parable ***was*** based upon a recognition
 of the

 reasons for their weakness, and these were the subjects that He illus-

 trated. Faulty faith results from wrong motives. True faith issues

 in right motives.

 Take the two figures. First, a grain of mustard seed. In the para-

 bolic discourses of Jesus in Matthew xiii., He used the same figure in

 another application, and with another purpose. He then said of the

 grain of mustard seed, " which indeed is less than all seeds." He now

 took this very little thing, and said to these men their faith should
 be

 like it. What is the principle involved in that ? What is there in a

 least of all the seeds, grew. There we are face to face with the
 principle,

 which is that of life. He was insisting upon the life principle in the

 grain of mustard seed, and because of that, in its development, it
 will

 produce results.

There was an interesting picture in a recent paper of a curious

 growth, of an enormous piece of statuary split in two, because a seed

 had been dropped there, and as it developed and grew, its roots going

 downward, gathered force, and it had split the masonry, and finally

 the statue. No application was made of it. It was simply a curious

 picture. However it is interesting, in the light of an old story of a

 granite tomb in Italy, where a man was buried many years ago, who

 was flippant in his agnosticism to faith and to Christianity
 especially.

 He had given instructions that a slab of granite weighing many tons

 should be placed over the place of his burial, so that there should be

 no chance of his body ever coming up, if there was any resurrection !

 They placed his body in the grave, and placed the granite slab upon

 it. But a bird passing over, dropped a seed, just an acorn fell there,

 before they placed the granite slab. The oak tree in time split that

 granite slab ! That is all. We can make the application. The life

 other. To state it in the terms Jesus employed when asked which was

 simple justice. Legally she wanted redress. That is the

 intended to teach exactly the opposite. That may be challenged by

 those who quote and love the idea of knocking and knocking, and

 asking and asking, and praying, That may have its value, but that is

 not what our Lord was teaching here, but exactly the opposite. The

 whole teaching of the parable is intended to be one of contrast
 between

 the judge and God, and therefore contrast between the actions of the

 judge and the actions of God.

Everyone agrees that the contrast is suggested between the judge

 man, are found in this Gospel of Luke, the chronicler of God's second
 Man, and the last Adam. He, a Greek writer, portrays Him in all the
 perfection of His human nature. That may account for this appeal of
 some of his parables to the human heart.

 An honest consideration of this story shows that it is indeed the word
 of the Lord, quick and sharp, dividing asunder. It is a very
 searching, as well as comforting story. Like the previous parable, it
 is concerned with the subject of prayer. In that we had a revelation
 of God in the matter of prayer, as He was contrasted in His character
 and in His dealings, with the unrighteous judge. In this parable we
 have a revelation of human nature in the attitudes, or activities of
 prayer, in the presence of God.

 which the parable opens, " And He spake also this parable unto certain
 which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and set all
 others at nought." We at once see why the parable was uttered. It was
 spoken to a certain personal and relative attitude. The personal
 attitude is revealed in the word, they " trusted in themselves that
 they were righteous." That phrase illuminates the whole situation of
 the Pharisees, and those closely associated with them. They believed

 when He spoke this parable. They were trusting in *themselves* that

 they were righteous.

 *Then* the relative attitude of these men is revealed in that pregnant

 is seen again and again in the Gospels. Once some of these men

 addressed the crowd, and spoke of them as cursed, those who did not

 know the law. Here is an attitude of life, personally trusting in
 oneself,

 believing one is righteous, and at the same time, setting all the rest

 at nought.

 Luke says specifically in the ninth verse that it was these attitudes

 our Lord had in mind. These personal and relative attitudes are seen

 in the light of God. Two men were in the Temple, and men were look-

 ing at them. The crowds would see them, and form their own opinion

 concerning them. Jesus stood quietly there, and said in effect, Look

 Now look at the figure employed. Here we are in the presence of

 men went up into the Temple to pray." They both went to the temple,

 and they both went to pray. At that point this story becomes
 searching.

 Then we begin to see the difference. What is the first thing about

 addressing God. He used the Name at the beginning of his prayer.

 as the place where men come to deal with God, and he began his

 prayer with a recognition of God.

 He prayed, separated from these others. He knew enough of this man

 In that prayer can be read all the scorn there was in his heart for

 men. He was telling God that he had abstained from vulgar

 sins.

 acquire, I set aside the tenth of everything obtained in the course of

 my business. This man was talking to God. He began by addressing

 Him, and he told God that he had abstained from certain vulgar

 forms of sin, and that he was very careful to observe certain rites or

 ceremonies.

Why was he telling God these things ? Evidently this was his

 conception of God. He would not have written down what was in his

 subliminal consciousness. This man thought of God as One satisfied

 with trivialities, abstaining from vulgar sins, and the observing of

 certain rites and ceremonies, We may go further and say he thought

 God was obligated to him, because of these things. He went up to

 fling up into clear and sharp relief the picture of the Pharisee. He

 spoke this parable to those who trusted in their own righteousness,

 as this Pharisee did, despising others, He might have left it there,

 but no. He drew attention to another man, this publican, standing

 afar off, suggesting a different attitude. The Pharisee was in all
 prob-

 ability pressing as near as he could to the altar. This man perhaps
 was

 just within the Temple, the holy place. He had crept in, and stood

 are two personalities within it. Who are they ? God and himself ;

 because he has abstained from vulgarity, and has kept up certain rites

 and forms and ceremonies. The other conception of God is of One

 Who is holy, in Whose presence a sinning man needs mercy ; but One

 to Whom he can come, and with downcast eyes, and beating on his

 breast, breathe out the sighing of his soul for mercy. That is the

 picture, and what a picture it is.

 The teaching again is self-evident and declared. When Jesus had

 finished His parable, He had not quite ended. He had something else

 to say. He had to utter a judgment, to make an appraisement, to pass

 had been watching and listening to Pharisee and publican, and Jesus
 now told us the result. He said, " This man went down to his house
 justified rather than the other." That is the appraisement, that is
 the judgment, that is the verdict concerning this publican. It is
 interesting to see some expositors are a little at pains to tell us
 that Jesus did not mean there what we ***now*** mean by being

 a wonderful variety of methods of illustration. He took things near at

 to make a protest against his becoming king. When they arrived in Rome

 see it would not be. He was going away to receive a Kingdom, and He
 was leaving responsibility with His servants for the period of His
 absence. That was the place of the parable and the figure employed ;
 and that was the purpose for which He uttered the parable. It was to
 teach them that they were wrong in expecting the Kingdom of God
 immediately to appear.

 What are we to learn from this parable ? Some people are expecting

 Postponement of His Kingship ? Certainly not, but of its
 mani-festation in full power and authority and ultimate victory. That
 is what was and is postponed, and it is still postponed. The life of
 our Lord did not begin when He was born a Baby. It stretches out to
 the past eternity, and on through all the infinite ages. Therefore it
 is

 until the hour of ultimate victory. He is reigning now, and the time
 of His coronation was at His ascension.

 But He wanted these disciples to see that what they were looking for,
 which they did not understand, was that the visible and outward
 victory was postponed ; that He was going away to receive a Kingdom.
 He received it when He was received up, and God set Him at His own
 right hand, upon His holy hill of Zion, His anointed King.

 Then there is a period of waiting, between His receiving the King-dom
 in the high court of heaven, and His coming finally to establish it
 visibly on earth. Here is the heart and centre of our parable. When
 the king was gone, he gave to his servants ; ten of them being named.
 That is a symbolic reference, and covers the whole ground. He gave ten
 pounds to ten servants, a pound to each. This parable of the pounds
 must not be confused with the parable of the talents, recorded by
 Matthew. The significance of the talents was the varying gifts that
 may be bestowed. Here in this parable it is equal opportunity. The
 pound is a deposit, intended to be used in the interest of the passing

 that they were to take the common deposit, and use it in the interest

 is a word that marks the activity of the merchants and the market
 place, " buying up the opportunity." This is not the usual word for
 redeeming, or for time. The meaning is the opportunity. Our business
 then, according to Paul, is to buy up the opportunity, to prosecute
 the commerce of the Kingdom of God with such diligence as
 characterizes the success of the merchant-men in the market places of
 the world. That is the idea.

 There is no Christian man or woman without that pound. We may say we
 have not ten talents, but that is another matter. The pound is
 something other than the gift. The pound is a deposit, and is the
 Gospel of the grace of God. We are witnesses to that Gospel. Our

 The pound did it itself. But he had simply fulfilled the
 responsibility

 of trading with it, and there were ten.

 Another man had not so full, but a partial result-five. Then that

other man who had the deposit, did not use it, but took care of it,

wrapped it up in a napkin, did not trade with it ; and the reason he

gave was that he knew his lord was stern, and that he reaped where

 he did not sow.

 But He is coming back. About that there is no question. When

 He comes again He will come as King ; not to be made King. Then

 the Kingdom of God will appear according to this parable. The first

 activity of His reappearing will be the investigation of what His

 servants have done with His pound. Where there has been full fidelity

 the Almighty, the durability of God.

 What is rock in the natural world ? The consolidation into one of
 varied constituent parts, resulting in strength and durability. When
 that is applied to God, it suggests that His strength results from the
 perfect harmony of all the facts of His Being in the unity of His
 God-head. That is why God is strong, changeless, and even the

 could transmute it into rock. No word He used ever revealed more

 His confidence in Himself, " Thou shalt be called rock,"

 Of course the one thing that comes to the heart in conclusion is

 this, the worth of human personality. It can be changed from shale

 to rock, but only in one way. That is the way of the meeting with

 Jesus, and the yielding to Him, and the trusting in Him, and the

 obeying of Him. If any man, however shifty, however much the friends

 standing not at the top of the stairway, as our translation might lead
 us to think, above it. No, He was right there, on the earth by the
 side of Jacob. The ladder, the stairway, was standing. When Jacob
 woke, He saw the stairway, he said, God is here ; Lo, God is in this
 place.

 and there is the picture out of the dream. Jacob and Jehovah close
 together, and right from the place where they were close together in
 the dream, the sweeping stairway moved up until it was lost in heaven.
 Ascending and descending messengers of heaven in their order-angels is
 the true word, which means in the Old Testament as in the New,
 messengers-were going up, bearing messages. They were coming down,
 bearing messages. That is the picture.

 I believe Nathanael had been reading about Jacob when he was under the
 fig-tree. I believe he had read of his home-coming when

 greater things. You shall see heaven opened, as Jacob did, when he was
 going out from home. You shall see heaven open, and you shall see what
 Jacob saw, angels ascending and descending upon the stair-way, and the
 way shall be the Son of man. The figure He was using was that of the
 ancient dream.

 What did that mean to Jacob at the time ? It was a revelation of
 Jehovah's care for him, of Jehovah's love of him. I stress again the
 point that how at that moment he was going away from home under a
 cloud. Nobody can defend his action by which he gained what he

 was going out under a cloud. Of *course* distances to-day are so
 different. Take the map, and look at his journey. The country from
 which he passed, and the country to which he was going. It meant
 complete exile from home. One can easily imagine his restlessness that
 night, and his sense of loneliness, accentuated by the conviction that
 it was his own wrongdoing that was driving him out. He had this
 vision, and he found that God was there.

 man.

In that whole scene, and in that use of the figure of speech gathered

 from a piece of history in the sacred writings with which Nathanael

 was most familiar, undoubtedly there stands for us for evermore a

 revelation of the fact of the interrelationship between heaven and

 earth, that they are not divided, that they are not so far apart, that

 earth can have dealing with heaven, and heaven dealing with earth.

 That was the general lesson taught by the vision of Jacob, and that

 was the tremendous fact Jesus had come to teach humanity at

 large.

Mark how the two spheres merge in His own Personality, the Son

 of God and the Son of man. He belonged to the heavenly abode and

 the heavenly region and the heavenly order. Yes, but He belonged

 to the earthly region and abode and order. He was Son of man.

 Heaven and earth were linked in His Person. And it was an unveiling

 of that fact that He announced to men through Himself. Through

 man. In having the sign of authority, He revealed the nature of His
 authority; His right to cleanse the temple, His right to heal, His
 right to do whatever He did was vested in the mystery of His death,
 and the marvel of His resurrection. If it is said to-day, and it is
 terribly true, there are multitudes of people who are seeking a sign,
 and ques-tioning His authority, they constitute an evil and adulterous
 generation. That sign abides.

 beautiful in holiness as it was. No, the thing that proves His
 authority is His death and His resurrection. Not the death alone. Of
 course there is no such thing as resurrection if there is no such
 thing as death. The death was brought about by the evil heart of man.
 The resurrec-tion was brought about by the almighty power of God.
 These two things together.

 They constitute the abiding sign of our Lord's authority for the world
 to-day, for this age, for this city, for this nation. What authority

 revela-tion of His authority. We have laws, and an ethical system, and
 call it Christianity. It is not Christianity. We can have a
 psychological approach to the problems of the human mind, but it is
 not Christianity. Christianity is vested in the absolute final
 authority of Christ, and the sign of it is His death and resurrection.

 This was the man who sought an interview with Jesus.

 The first twenty-one verses of this chapter give us the story of that
 interview. Some believe that the words of our Lord recorded in this
 chapter ceased at the fifteenth verse, and that the paragraph
 com-mencing, " For God so loved the world," constituted John's
 inter-pretation of what our Lord was saying. Without arguing about it,
 I reject that view, and am convinced the words in verse sixteen fell
 from the lips of our Lord Himself. In the midst, however, of the story

 question. Do not go away and speak of the ignorance of Nicodemus. It
 was an important question. It was a tremendous question.

 How did our Lord answer that ? This leads to the illustration,

 end of time.

 The word occurs in more than one hundred and fifty passages in the New
 Testament ; twenty of which are in this Gospel of John. It is always

 book of Revelation we read that one beast had power to com-municate

 high value, a current of air, a breath, a breeze. The root of it is in
 that passage in Acts, " a mighty rushing wind." Here there can be no

We pause here to notice that there was an essential difference

 question, but a serious one, revealing the fact that this man was
 thinking. He did not deny what Christ had suggested as to the value of
 a new beginning. Jesus said, " Except a man be born from above he
 cannot see the Kingdom of God." Nicodemus did not question that for a
 moment. What he did question was the possibility of the thing
 suggested. How can a man be born all over again, as though the first
 had never been. He is what he is as the result of all the years that
 have gone. How can he start again ? It was an honest question, an
 intelligent question, but it was one revealing a great deal of doubt
 as to the possibility.

 was going ; so is every *man* born of the Spirit. Every man that is
 born of the Spirit obeys the law of the force, which cannot be denied,
 although he cannot understand the mystery of the activity.

 When Nicodemus heard that, he then asked this question, not how the
 thing happened, but How can the thing be brought to pass? He was still
 in the same realm of difficulty. The word he used is a very

 It was in answer to that question that our Lord used the illustration
 of the uplifted serpent. We may now proceed with the same three lines
 of consideration. First, the subject illustrated. Secondly, the

 figure He employed. Finally, of course, the teaching deducted for us

 and for all time.

 What was the subject that Jesus was illustrating when He used

 the earthly things, the necessity on the earth level for a new per-

 sonality. He had illustrated that by a natural figure of speech, the

 blowing of the wind. He had told him earthly things, and Nicodemus

 was still in doubt. He could not understand. How would he believe

 if He drew aside the curtain and revealed the heavenly things. The

 earthly things declared were those of necessity for a man to be born

 from above, starting anew on the earth level. Nicodemus, you ask how

 the action whereby a man can, by the reception of a new life from

 above, escape from his past. That is what had puzzled Nicodemus at

 first, how he could not only see but enter into the whole experience
 of

 realm of natural phenomena, He now used an illustration in the realm

 of historic record. Nicodemus knew the Old Testament. He was the

 teacher of Israel, and he knew the Scriptures. We are familiar with
 it.

 The story is in Numbers xxi., the account of how Moses lifted up the

 serpent in the wilderness.

In looking at this figure, what did this uplifted serpent mean ?

But we have not reached the lifted serpent. That is only

 the background. Why was the serpent lifted ? It was lifted

 because the people had rebelled against God, and because as the

 result of their rebellion they were suffering punishment. That was

 why.

Now, said Jesus, as Moses lifted up that serpent ; and we go back

 with the simplicity of children to the story in Numbers, and say, Why

 did Moses lift it up, and what did it mean when it was lifted up ?
 First,

 two words here in the figure of speech.

 It is water always flowing, as distinct from water gathered up, and

 kept. There is a beautiful phrase in the Old Testament on the material

 or physical level, where we are told in the Book of Genesis that
 Isaac's

 servants digged in the valley " and found there a well of springing

 water." That is the same thought, living water, water always coming

 up, always passing on. We shall consider the figure again later on,

 in another and wider application. Now we are simply looking at

 the figure.

 Living water is water always bubbling up and flowing, always

 coming. Water in a glass by our side, is excellent, but it is not

 when

 it is gathered, and stored and kept. Jesus used that as a figure,

 water ; not the well in which there is an accumulation of water,

 but a spring that keeps the well full, however much water is drawn

 from it.

 What a wonderful figure of speech, living water. Jesus is con-

 fronting a thirsty soul, and is using the illustration that is close
 at

 hand. The woman called it a well. He spoke of a spring, of that

 which had brought the water into the well. She had come far to draw

 the collected water. Lifting His illustration on to the realm of per-

 **HIS** is a. very remarkable parabolic illustration used by our Lord.

 This is he of whom it is written,

 So in that sense he was more than a prophet.

 But he was distinctly a prophet, perfectly fulfilling in his public
 ministry, the prophetic office. We remember that Peter said on another

 his message he gathered up all the foretelling, all the hopes and all
 the aspirations of those prophets who had given witness to the Christ.
 He was the forerunner, the immediate forerunner of the Christ, and
 therefore the culminating word of the long line of prophets.

In this way this illustration of our Lord applied specifically to him ;

 custom and consider three matters. We enquire, What was the subject
 illustrated by our Lord. Then we will examine the figure itself, in
 order that we may deduce the abiding teaching.

 them back. We are not unfair to them in saying that, because Jesus
 said to them, in verse twenty-six, " Ye seek Me, not because ye saw
 signs, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled." They ate
 loaves yesterday, and they had come back to-day. Whereas it does not
 say so in so many words, they hoped for another manifestation They did
 not take any cognizance of the sign it was intended of power.

 to signify.

 Do not work for the meat which perishes. They had worked, *some of*
 them, pretty hard, in the hope of a meal that day. They had gone all
 round the lake. They had put out a good deal of effort to get there,
 to find Him. They did not want to understand. They were not seeking
 for interpretation. The sign did not appeal to them. The thing that
 brought them there was the fact of their full bellies yesterday. He
 rebuked that, and called them to another kind of effort, of output, of
 strength that resulted in the meat that did not perish, that would
 bring them to the place of meat that endureth to eternal Iife. That is
 the subject which our Lord was illustrating.

 Now look at the figure in itself, bread, the bread of life. We are not
 touching the spiritual level yet ; though in dealing with the figure,

 While we are not yet dealing with the spiritual things, they are
 shining through. Our Lord used a figure of speech. They had referred
 to the manna, and He had taken it up and dealt with food.

 It is wonderful how we can change and reduce some of the things at
 which we have been looking to-day. Food, what are the things we really
 need ? Protein, carbohydrate, fat. In recent years we have added

 ing into any controversy such as had gathered around this saying of
 Jesus, suffice it for us to dismiss the idea that this saying of our
 Lord has anything to do with what we call the Holy Communion. It has
 been applied in that way largely by certain theologians of whom we
 speak with respect, but from whom we profoundly differ. Our Lord was
 not referring to the Communion here at all, not even in **a**
 secondary sense. But seeing that a great deal of controversy has waged
 around this saying through the running years of theological
 consideration, at least it behoves us to consider this carefully, and

 pray for the help of the Spirit to an understanding of what our Lord

 really meant.

 So, taking our usual method, we consider first, what was the subject

 He intended to illustrate, for it was an illustration. Secondly, we
 pause

 with the figure itself, which He employed. Necessarily therefore from

 that consideration of the subject and figure we proceed to deduce the

 teaching which He gave.

 sarily from those two lines of preliminary thought, we consider the
 great teaching.

 Here we are face to face with something perhaps a little unusual, and
 yet full of value. In other considerations we have had to enquire what
 was our Lord intending to illustrate by the use of that particular
 figure. In this case we have no need to ask that question. We are in
 no doubt in this case, because this figure of speech was immediately
 followed in the narrative of John by exposition. This is stated in

 yet glorified. That was His subject, in the light of that inspired
 inter-

 Holy Spirit. He was looking forward to a new giving of the Spirit,

 which undoubtedly at the moment had not been granted, neither was

 it granted until Pentecost.

 Later on in His life He spoke to His disciples of the coming of

 the Spirit, and spoke of it as the promise of the Father, which said

 He, He will send unto you. Here He was looking on in His own work,

 looking on to the ultimate in His own work, the coming of the Spirit

 in a new way, and in new measure. We cannot read the Old Testament

 without coming into the presence of the Spirit. We see the Son in

 the beginning of our Bible, the Word, and the Spirit of God brooding

 upon the face of the chaos. But His coming to man was spasmodic

 If we can get back into the mind of the Lord, it is evident from

 this word of interpretation, He was looking on to that giving of the

 Spirit ; and John has told us why that had not been done, and

 why that Spirit had not been given in that new sense. Why not ?

 Read again the twelfth chapter of John, and then read the seventeenth,

 another occasion He did not stand, but sat, While that does not mean

The great teaching here is this, that the life-giving Spirit is **t o**

 be amended, and put thus. The proportion in which the rivers con-

 tinuously flow is the proportion in which we have ceased to be

 of this woman. We are not dealing with the story now.

At the twelfth verse we read, " Again therefore Jesus spake unto

 them." It is the resumption of teaching, broken in upon. He had been

 interrupted by these scribes and this woman. When that was over,

 used for light is common in the New Testament, as common as our

 word light is ; the word *Phos* was common to the people who heard

 used, *Phos* is derived from a word that means to shine, in order to

 we discover at once light is a simple thing, and a vastly sublime
 thing.

 So the figure He made use of here I do not hesitate to say is very

 simple, so that every boy who perchance was in the temple courts,

 or youth near by, seeing the light all about them in the early
 morning,

 would understand and see. But examine it. Some say that light

 consists of seven primary colours, red, orange, yellow, green, blue,

 indigo, violet. Strictly, however, there are only three primary
 colours,

 red, blue, and yellow. All the others result from some combination

 of red, blue, and yellow. I remember the thrill that came to me as

 of all these, 'and they are brought into one, the red and blue and

 " All that came before Me are thieves and robbers." That verse seems

 to have troubled some people. He was not referring to the prophets

 and Moses. He was referring to those who were claiming that final

 authority that these men claimed, when they excommunicated the

 man. In that sense in which they had claimed authority they were

 only thieves and robbers. He claimed to be the door, the Superseder

 of a failing order.

My mind travels away to that parenthesis in the letter to the

 Hebrews, when the writer said " The law made nothing perfect."

 There the reference was not to the law of God merely, but to the whole

 economy supposedly based upon the law of God. But it had perfected

 nothing. All it had done in the case of this man was to put him
 outside,

 excommunicate him. Jesus once said, addressing these very rulers,

So that if we speak of death as sleep we must recognize that the

 only One Who can wake out of sleep is our Lord Himself, the only

 One Who can bring back into consciousness those fallen on sleep. No

 one else can. We remember that old trite quotation from Gray's

 W **E FIND** ourselves now in the last hours of our Lord's public

 ministry. As we follow the records, the incident recorded in this

 entry to Jerusalem, and His conflict with the rulers. At the end of

 that conflict there had shone upon Him that gleam of light as the poor

 widow, passing the treasury, had shown her devotion to the God of her

 fathers as she cast in all her living. Then it was that the Greeks
 came.

 We should note that these were Greeks, not Greek Jews. There is a

 distinction clearly seen by the reader of the Greek New Testament

 between Hellenes, and Hellenistes. These were Hellenes-Greeks.

Immediately after this incident we have the chapters thirteen to

 the spirit of meekness. As we do that, the grace of our Lord Jesus
 Christ shines out, and the glory of the triumph of love is manifested
 in us and through us.

 Immediately after the parabolic action of the washing of the

 Our Lord did not create this figure. He borrowed it, and without any
 hesitation I say that He borrowed it from the Old Testament. We find
 the figure of the vine employed in the Book of Psalms. That is the
 first occurrence (Psalm 80). It is called the psalm of Asaph. It was
 written in a time when God's people were in trouble as the result of
 their own disobedience, as so constantly they were in trouble.

 He says,

 Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears,\
 And given them tears to drink in large measure.\
 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours."

 That is the first part of the psalm,

And cause Thy face to shine, and we shall be saved."

 Then the singer broke out into this language,

 The psalm closes with this remarkable passage,

 He promised never to leave me,\
 Never to leave me alone."

 If we are branches in the vine, that means all the redemptive forces
 that the world needs are in Him, and as the result of His coming.
 Those resources are all at the world's disposal through those who are
 branches in the vine.

 We are Christians ; we must all bear the cross. That is not the cross.

 We have never touched the cross so long as our suffering is purely

 personal. We have only touched the cross when we are in fellowship

through our sorrows and our suffering may be brought into life.
