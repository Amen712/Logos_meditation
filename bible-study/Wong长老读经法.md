这是我领受的黄长老讲的方式，总结如下：

A. 基础
    1. 圣父： 圣经都是　神所默示的，于教训、督责、使人归正、教导人学义都是有益的， 属　神的人得以完全，预备行各样的善事
    2. 圣子： 你们查考圣经，因你们以为内中有永生；给我作见证的就是这经。然而，你们不肯到我这里来得生命。
    3. 圣灵： 只等真理的圣灵来了，他要引导你进入一切的真理；因为他不是凭自己说的，乃是把他所听见的都说出来，并要把将来的事告诉你们。 14他要荣耀我，因为他要将受于我的告诉你们。

B. 态度
    1. 神的神能已将一切关乎生命和虔敬的事赐给我们，皆因我们认识那用自己荣耀和美德召我们的主。 因此，他已将又宝贵又极大的应许赐给我们，叫我们既脱离世上从情欲来的败坏，就得与 神的性情有份。 
    2. 正因这缘故，你们要分外地殷勤；
        a. 有了信心，又要加上德行；
        b. 有了德行，又要加上知识； 
        c. 有了知识，又要加上节制；
        d. 有了节制，又要加上忍耐；
        e. 有了忍耐，又要加上虔敬； 
        f. 有了虔敬，又要加上爱弟兄的心；
        g. 有了爱弟兄的心，又要加上爱众人的心。 
    3. 你们若充充足足地有这几样，就必使你们在认识我们的主耶稣基督上不至于闲懒不结果子了。 
    4. 人若没有这几样，就是眼瞎，只看见近处的，忘了他旧日的罪已经得了洁净。 
    5. 所以弟兄们，应当更加殷勤，使你们所蒙的恩召和拣选坚定不移。你们若行这几样，就永不失脚； 
    6. 这样，必叫你们丰丰富富地得以进入我们主救主耶稣基督永远的国。
    7. 喜乐-读经乐：饥渴慕义的人有福了！因为他们必得饱足。靠主而得的喜乐是我的力量。


C. 方法：
    a. 祷告  
    b. 读经  （圣灵启示） 
    c. 默想  （圣灵解释）
    d. 领受  （光照心意更新〉
    e. 行出来（圣灵加力量）
D. 操练：请大家读希伯来书，请尝试按照下面的原则：
    1. 读之前，好好祷告，以祷告和领受的心态开始。祈求圣灵带领和开启
    2. 尽量一口气读完全卷书。（mindmap）
    3。读的过程中专注于读出圣灵的组织,注重书的mission和圣灵的组织（启示或者感动），需要揣摩圣徒在写经文的心态如罗马书是欠福音的债的欠债人的心态
    4. 读之后，反复揣摩反刍，看看有什么领受（光照，内化）
    5. 请把领受记下来我们周日一起分享讨论。或者自己组织，背下来，发表或在操练，看看耶稣是如何行的，像他一样。（犹太人方法，Feynman Techniques)


Below is Elder Wong's bible study methods blessed His 86 years of life and onwards:

A. Foundation: 
    1: Holy Father: 16All Scripture is inspired by God and beneficial for teaching, for rebuke, for correction, for training in righteousness; 17so that the man or woman of God may be fully capable, equipped for every good work.

    2: Holy son: You examine the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is those very Scriptures that testify about Me; 40and yet you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.

    3: Holy spirit: But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own, but whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come. 14He will glorify Me, for He will take from Mine and will disclose it to you.

B. Attitude:

    1: for His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence. 
    2: Through these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world on account of lust. 
    3:Now for this very reason also, applying all diligence:
        a. in your faith supply moral excellence, and 
        b. in your moral excellence, knowledge, and 
        c. in your knowledge, self-control, and 
        d. in your self-control, perseverance, and 
        e. in your perseverance, godliness, and 
        f. in your godliness, brotherly kindness, and 
        g. in your brotherly kindness, love. 
    4: For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they do not make you useless nor unproductive in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    5: For the one who lacks these qualities is blind or short-sighted, having forgotten his purification from his former sins. 
    6: Therefore, brothers and sisters, be all the more diligent to make certain about His calling and choice of you; for as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble; 11for in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you.
    7: Joy -thirst and hunger satisfied through reading Bible:  “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.Do not be grieved, for the joy of the Lord is your refuge.

C: Method: 
    a: praying (filled with Holy spirit)
    b: reading (Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask me what I should do for you before I am taken from you.” And Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.”)
    c: meditate (Spirit explain and remind)
    d: reflection(Holy spirit baptism and renewal)
    e: live out (Therefore there is now no condemnation at all for those who are in Christ Jesus. 2For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death. for if you are living in accord with the flesh, you are going to die; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live. )

D：Practice:
    1: before you start to read a bible book (39+27, 4 Gospels the first) Pray for Holy spirit to guide, lead and reveal
    2: try to read the whole at once (mindmap?)
    3: during the reading: focusing on: mission of the book and how it is orgainzed by Holy spirit. motivation. if possible memorized, read in as a the role player and act out
    4: medidate day and night, reflection and born again
    5: write down, publish or preach out to yourself or others. (Feynman Techniques)

Roman 12， 合乎中道： organic body， 不要用人意来谬讲神道。不是揣摩而是找人的意思。圣灵会启示。
3. 神的话一解开，我们就行。

‪提摩太前书‬4:13 和合本
13 你要以宣读、劝勉、教导为念，直等到我来。

‪马太福音‬13:51-52 和合本
51 耶稣说：“这一切的话你们都明白了吗？”他们说：“我们明白了。” 52 他说：“凡文士受教作天国的门徒，就像一个家主从他库里拿出新旧的东西来。” 圣经就是这个宝库

‪使徒行传‬4:28-30 和合本
28 成就你手和你意旨所预定必有的事。 29-30 他们恐吓我们，现在求主鉴察，一面叫你仆人大放胆量讲你的道，一面伸出你的手来医治疾病，并且使神迹奇事因着你圣仆（“仆”或作“子”）耶稣的名行出来。”

圣仆人=有神一切的丰盛，+ 主谦卑 （马可福音） +歌罗西书。 我们很穷。
