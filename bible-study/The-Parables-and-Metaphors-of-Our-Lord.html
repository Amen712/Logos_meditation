In the course of these thirty-four verses there are two sections dealing with the reason of His parabolic method.  The first is found in verses ten to twelve. There He answered a question, and told the disciples the reason of His method.  The second section is in verses twenty-one to twenty-five, again an explanation of His method.</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">In the first paragraph we have not a full explanation from our Lord, and that section demands the second paragraph.

He had used parabolic illustrations before this time, notably to the woman of <span><img width="49" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_252.gif"/></span> when He spoke of the water of life  to the disciples, when He told them fields were white to harvest   in Nazareth, when He spoke of th e physician and his healing work   to the disciples again, of fishers of men  and in His Manifesto, of salt and light and building.  But the Sower was the first full parable, uttered at this time.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Tracing the course of our Lord’s ministry we shall find that there had come a moment when definite and positive hostility had hardened in a peculiar manner.  In the home at Capemaum He had been chal- lenged, because He had claimed to forgive sins.  In the house of Levi He had been challenged because He permitted His disciples to omit fasting, and because He consorted with sinners.  In the cornfields He had been criticized for allowing His disciples to pluck the ears of corn on the Sabbath.  In a synagogue on a later Sabbath, He was challenged,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p class="s30" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IO  <span class="s31">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">and they counselled to destroy Him.  Again, in the house in Capernaum He was charged with being in complicity with the devil.   All this had its definite effect upon the minds of the people.  In the third chapter we</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="21" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_253.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_254.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_255.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 18pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">it said,  He looked round about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart.”  That was the mental condition of the hour, of the rulers, which affected the crowds.   This hardening of heart meant callousness, blindness, determination not to listen, nor to obey</p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">or if to listen, then only critically, and destructively.</p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">At that time Jesus adopted this parabolic method when speaking to the multitudes.  When their hardness of heart made Him angry, then</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_256.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in a very definite and enlarged form He began to use parables    His anger being the result of His grace, in the presence of their attitude.</p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The difficulty here is found in the tenth to twelfth verses.    Much has been said about it, and there have been differing interpretations.</p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The apparent meaning of the passage is that Jesus adopted the method of the parable to prevent these people understanding, and to be forgiven.  That is the first impression made upon the mind as the verses are read.</p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">There have been two methods of dealing with that difficulty.   The first is that this is a truth which must be accepted though not under- stood.  Some Bible teachers and expositors take the view that our Lord</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">deliberately adopted the parabolic method here that the people should not see, or understand, or be forgiven.   The second method of dealing with this passage is that the statement is not true, that He never said it, and therefore the passage is untrustworthy. That second method is impossible of belief by those who hold that the record is true.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_257.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">But is the difficulty due to what the passage really says, or to   <span><img width="28" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_258.gif"/></span><span class="s29"> </span>continued interpretation, or misinterpretation of it    Was the reason of the parabolic method that men should be prevented from under- standing, and so be excluded from the mercy of God ?    That would surely be blasphemy, and would contradict the whole purpose of God</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in Christ, and of Christ in the world.   Consequently we must look at this a little more particularly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_259.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_260.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_261.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_262.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_263.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_264.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">There is one important fact to bear in mind, that the narrative of Mark is condensed   and that of Luke is even more so at this point. Matthew’s account is much fuller.   In the thirteenth chapter of that Gospel, after the parable of the sower,   The disciples came, and said unto Him, Why speakest Thou unto them in parables     And He answered,   Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.   For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance   but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.   Therefore speak I to them in parables   because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.” Carefully notice the change.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_265.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_266.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 7pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Seeing they see not,”  not that they may not see.

The  lest  is the  lest   of their attitude, their hardness, of their persistence in unbelief.  He was grieved with their hardness of heart, and that was the reason why He adopted the parabolic method. They had hardened their hearts until they had become gross   until they with seeing eyes were nevertheless blind. That was their attitude. They had done this lest they should be drawn back to God, and halted, and be forgiven. They were not aware of that ultimate, but that was their condition.</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Carry the thought a little further. According to Matthew, the disciples had enquired the reason for speaking in parables.  The Lord’s answer was that it was given to them to know the mysteries.  He told His disciples that the difference in method was due to a difference in relationship.  To those of His disciples who were obedient, who sub- mitted to Him, the mysteries could be made known.  To those without, those not yielded, and not obedient, those refusing and hardening the heart, the parabolic was the necessary method.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_280.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_281.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: right;">Go on to verses twenty-one to twenty-five in this fourth chapter of Mark. He used the lamp as His illustration. This lamp is not put under the bushel, which would extinguish it.  It is put on a stand. The parables therefore constituted a lamp, a lamp shining.  It was not in order to hide things, but that the hidden things might be brought to light.  These people could not, because of the attitude they had assumed, receive the mysteries, the profound things of the Kingdom of God.  His disciples could receive those mysteries  but to those without, the parable was a lamp. There is nothing hidden except that it may be manifested.  There is nothing secret but that it may be revealed. He gave them parabolic pictures, so that they might enquire.  The purpose of the story, the picture, was to lure them to think, in order that they might find their way into the higher mystery. Therefore  it  is  important  that  the  passage  in  Mark  should  be interpreted by the fuller passage in Matthew. Take that matchless triptych  of  stories  constituting  one  great  parable,  recorded  in  the fifteenth chapter of Luke, the lost sheep, the lost silver, and the lost son. That was spoken to men who <span class="s32">were </span>blundering,  and  protesting against Him.  There is nothing in that story of the mysteries of the Kingdom  but it is there.  Can we suppose Jesus told those men that story of lost things sought, and found, in order to prevent their coming</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_282.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_283.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to God, and finding mercy   If they had heard that story, enquired concerning it, sought its deep significance, they would have found themselves in the presence of all the height and depth and length and breadth of the mystery of the Kingdom of God.</p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">In other words, the parable is ever the open door to the mystery. If men will consider the picture, and enquire, He will always answer. The parables therefore do but illustrate the whole fact of His approach to the human heart.</p><p style="padding-left: 104pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">There is a remarkable statement in the Proverbs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_284.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_285.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 134pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">It is the glory of God to conceal a thing</p><p style="padding-left: 134pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">But the glory of kings is to search out a matter.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That is true in Nature.   God conceals behind that which is sacramental that which is supreme, so that men may take the thing that is manifest, and so following and enquiring, may find the deep secret.    It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, but it is the glory of kings to search out a matter.  The writer did not mean merely kings on the earthly level, but the kingly nature, which is always seeking for the secret thing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_286.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_287.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The same philosophy is in the great word of Moses, uttered long <span class="s33">ago,   </span>The secret things belong unto the Lord our God   but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever.”    The secret things are there that we may discover them.    Nature is a great parable. Think of the earth, and of research, the things man has been finding out.   They were all there from the beginning, but were hidden.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_288.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_289.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">With reverence let it be said that the Lord Himself and the whole fact of the Incarnation is a parable.

What was the subject with which our Lord was dealing, and which He intended to illustrate     The influence that was to be exerted by the subjects of His Kingdom.   He had begun with those wonderful beatitudes    and then had enunciated certain laws, and showed that in His Kingdom character was supreme. He had proceeded to show that the reasons of such character is not so much of personal value, but of the influence such character exerts. Oh, the marvel of these illustrations, their choosing, the brilliance of them, the finality of them.   Whenever He spoke He did so with authority, the authority not of dogmatism, but of inherent, necessary, and inevitable  truth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_303.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_304.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">The influence then is twofold, salt and light.   There is a distinction and a difference, and yet the figures merge into one thought,    salt of the earth,”   light of the world.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_305.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_306.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 22pt;text-align: left;">Salt of the earth.”   What is the value of salt    It is not anti- septic, but aseptic. Antiseptic is something which is against poison,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_307.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 134pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="28" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_308.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">and which tends to its cure.  Aseptic is something which is devoid of poison in itself. Salt never cures corruption. It prevents the spread of corruption.  If meat is tainted and corrupt, salt will not make it untainted and pure. But salt in its neighbourhood will prevent the spread of corruption to that which otherwise would become tainted. The figure is that of a moral quality operating on the earth level, amongst men living in the midst of material things, preventing the spread of corruption. The impurity of an evil man cannot be cured by a good man, working at his side in an <span><img width="35" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_309.png"/></span> but the things the good man will not do, and the things he will not say will give the boy in the same     a chance, because it will check the evil man. Salt is aseptic.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_310.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_311.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_312.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: right;">The function of the subjects of His Kingdom is to live in the midst of humanity in the terrible condition of sin, and by living there accord- ing to the ethic of the Kingdom of God, to prevent the spread of evil. It is the Lord’s work to cure it, thank God. However impure and corrupt the heart may be, He can cleanse it, and make it purer than the driven snow.  The subjects of His Kingdom are so to live that they give goodness its opportunity, and hold in check the forces of corrup- tion.  Our Lord emphasized this with those words of satire, gentle, but clear and sharp as the lightning.   If the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted    I like the Scotch rendering of that, If the salt has lost its tang.”  That is a great word, tang, the pungent power of salt.  Jesus says His people are to exercise that influence in the world.  That is <span class="s25">our </span>responsibility, though <span class="s25">men may </span>not be pleased.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: right;">But again, not only the salt of the earth, referring to a moral quality</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_313.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_314.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_315.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_316.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_317.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">of things  but,   Ye are the light of the world.”  That refers to <span class="s38">a </span>spiritual revelation which is to radiate from these subjects of the Kingdom.  We are the light of the cosmos, of all the order, not merely of the earth, but of the universe.  We remember another occasion when the Master said,   I am the Light of the world.”  Linking this up with that great full word concerning Himself, we understand when we are yielded to Him, subjects of <span class="s25">His </span>Kingdom, obeying Him, then we too become the light of the world.  The quality of light is not that it desires to be looked at   Light enables other things to be seen by its  shining.  The sun is in the heaven, not to be looked at, but the sunshine enables us to see other things clearly.   Ye are the light of the world.”  Let your light so shine that men may glorify your Father. The light of the Christian shining in the world illuminates all the worldly order, so that men see the true way.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_318.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_319.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="14" height="2" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_320.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">In this connection two figures are employed by our Lord,  a city set on a hill,” and  a lamp   on the stand.”  The city set on a hill is for the illumination of vast distances.  No Christian can fulfil that ideal alone. That demands fellowship, a corporate relationship. That demands the whole Church.  Every church should be a city set on a hill, illuminating the far expanses of life.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">PARABOLIC  ILLUSTRATIONS  IN  THE  MANIFESTO  <span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_321.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Then He came from the figure of the city on a hill into a house, and there took the figure of a lampstand, illuminating the home, and ‘the near.   Inevitably the mind goes back to a word of the psalmist in the Old Testament,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_322.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 142pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, And light unto my path.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="26" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_323.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_324.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Keep the figures separate.   The light shines from some eminence, indicating the road, the pathway.   The light shines on the way to be trodden, so that the way may be found along the illuminated path by the lamp.  Thy word, says the psalmist, is a lamp.   Each  Christian man and woman has to      a double function in the world. The whole Church in its corporate relationship, in the bonds of love, friend- ship, and service, is to illuminate the distances   and then in the home,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_325.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">with the shut door, the lamp is to illuminate everything there.    Christ said here the lamp is not put under a bushel but on a stand.    Many years ago I heard that prince of expositors, Dr. Maclaren, say this illuminative thing :   No man lights a lamp and puts it under a bushel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="11" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_326.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If he did, what would happen ?   Either the bushel would put out the light, or the light would set the bushel on fire     We can apply that.

He was showing the folly of living such a life.   He showed what the attitude of His subjects should be towards necessary things, and the superlative things.   He was talking to them about amassing treasure, and He used finely sarcastic language about the treasures of earth   moth and rust corrupt,” and    thieves break through and steal.”   These are Eastern figures. At the time the wealth of the East consisted in fine fabrics, fine twined linen, and purple   and of metal, in coinage, or in precious things that rust spoiled. Treasure was kept underground, and there was the possibility of thieves digging and so treasure would be lost. The moth, the rust, make things</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_332.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">worthless. Thieves steal, and  everything is gone. Remember that thieves steal only things that are moth-eatable, and rust-consumable. There are things of possession, treasures in heaven,    where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.”  These things moths cannot touch, rust cannot corrode, thieves cannot  find.   Oh, the foolishness, the stupidity of men and women who think riches consist in treasures on the earth.    All the time the swift, silent messengers of destruction are breaking in upon it, and the equally silent corrosive fire of Nature is biting into the metal and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_333.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">destroying it.

The subject He was illustrating was the necessity for singleness of motive in life, having one aim, purpose, passion. He ended this section by saying,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_334.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Ye cannot serve God and mammon.”  He says the eye is the lamp of the body, not the light of the body.  Think of the human eye, and of its value.  If there be no light the eye is quite useless.  The light is not in the eye, but the eye is the means of interpreting the light and applying the light.  The eye is that which regulates the motions of the body. It is wonderful how those denied the great blessing of sight have other senses sharpened. But those blind would be the first to admit that the natural order is that the eye is the lamp, in which the light shines, and through which things are seen because light is shining.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_335.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_336.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_337.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_338.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Then with marvellous scientific accuracy, Jesus used two words as to the condition of the eye, the  single  eye, and the  evil  eye. The contrast is the more remarkable, in that it is not an exact contrast, which would have been single and double, or good and evil.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_339.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_340.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_341.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_342.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_343.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The word  single  is <span><img width="38" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_344.gif"/></span> which means single-folded, without a fold.  If thine eye has no complications within itself. Anyone who has visited an oculist has probably heard him use the word astigmatism. I give the definition of an authority.   An astigmatism is a structural defect of the eye so that rays of light do not converge to a point in the retina.”  That means there is some fold there, something out of place, something complicated. The eye is not single. The single eye is the opposite of the eye suffering from astigmatism.  Jesus said, If the eye is single, not folded over, nothing out of place, what then  Things are seen clearly, in right perspective, and the whole body is illumined, it is    of light.  The eye is the lamp, and the light shines through it into the whole body, and there is nothing complicated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_345.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Then He gave the contrast.   If thine eye be evil,” and the word is <span><img width="45" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_346.gif"/></span> evil in influence.  Now, He did not deal with the structure of the eye.  That had been indicated in what had already been said. The single eye is never evil, <span><img width="45" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_347.gif"/></span> The word now indicates not merely an obliquity of vision, but that there is a squint.  Everything is seen double.  That eye is evil in its influence upon the one possessing it and upon others.

Our Lord used all these as illustra- tions in His ethical teaching.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_354.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The birds and lilies are very familiar.   What then was the subject the Master was illustrating    That of the futility of anxiety about necessary  things.   In the former illustration of true wealth, the folly of laying up treasure destroyed by moth, rust, and stolen by thieves, He was not looking at necessary things.   If His subjects are not to be careful about laying up treasure on earth, there are things that are essential and necessary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_355.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_356.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">What are the necessary things    They are revealed in His teaching; food, drink, raiment.  Here He reduced everything to the last necessity. The word raiment here covers more than the covering of the body. Paul writing to Timothy says,   Having food and covering we shall be therewith content.”   Covering means not merely the covering of the body, but covering of our personality, shelter, home. That also was surely in the mind of our Lord.   Things can be accumulated, without any home.  However, keep to the simple ideas, food, drink, and raiment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="62" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_357.gif"/></span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">These are necessities to those in His Kingdom, until the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_358.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_359.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_360.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">tion.   He insisted upon the futility of being anxious about these necessities in a threefold repetition of a phrase,    Be not anxious.” The Authorized Version renders here,   Take no thought   for food and drink and raiment, which is a little misleading.    We are to take thought, but we are not to be anxious,   That is the important word, the anxiety which is car-king care, and that is unfruitful, feverish, and</p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">worrying.   How  constantly  His  subjects,  submitted  to  His  rule, face these problems of food, clothing, and covering, necessary things, until the anxiety reacts upon them, and they become hot and restless, fretful and worried.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_361.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">There is a threefold movement in the teaching.   He shows first that anxiety is unnecessary. The necessity is known to God.    Your Father knoweth that ye have need.” Secondly, it is unworthy. We are frittering away great forces that inspire life, on unworthy objects.</p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Direct that driving energy and urge of personality into its true line of action.   By seeking the Kingdom and His righteousness, we shall be taking our powers, and spending them in that way. Lastly, with a fine touch of satire, He says it is not only unnecessary and unworthy, it is quite unfruitful.

Either word carries the meaning. By worrying one cannot add a cubit to his stature, or live longer.  See the playful irony of the word.  Remember the teaching that has preceded this word the supremacy of character, revealed in the beatitudes, that character as influence, salt, and light, followed by binding laws.  We are still in the world, and must have food, drink, and raiment, necessary things. We are not to be anxious about these things.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_368.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_369.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">How shall we avoid anxiety   Jesus Iooked out upon the common, everyday things, the birds and the lilies, the Huleh lily of Palestine, varying from brilliant scarlet to a <span class="s25">fine </span>deep purple, one of the most gorgeous of the flowers, blooming there amid the fields where He was talking.  Look at the birds as they nestle there in these trees, and as they fly.  They have no intelligence that enables them to make pro- vision.  They have no gathering power.  They do not lay up in barns but they are fed, and the Father feedeth them.</p><p style="padding-left: 115pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">These are illustrations by contrast rather than similarity.  <b>If </b>our</p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">heavenly Father feeds those whom He has not endowed with a capacity for thinking and planning and arranging and Iaying by in store, how much more likely He will feed those whom He has created with the capacity to lay up, and arrange, and plan.  Man is intelligent, is made for forecasting, to arrange.  He is created with the intellectual capacity that enables him to do what the birds cannot do.  Our Father feeds the birds, notwithstanding their lack.  He will feed us on the basis of our possessions.  Man will use the faculties, but the greatness of his humanity, and all his cleverness will not feed him, unless God does so. The Lord was driving His listeners back to a recognition of the futility of worry and anxiety, teaching that the beings He has thus endowed and endued, using those powers so given, to such God always responds in supplying need.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="20" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_370.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Then He looked at the flowers.  He said, Look at them. God has garbed them, and all the glory of Solomon’s     twined linen and purple and flashing beauty do not compare with the beauty of those flowers.  Is anyone inclined to think that here Jesus used rhetoric ? No, it is cold, scientific fact. Some day take a piece of the finest material ever employed in the making of garments of kings, the most beautiful and costly, and most delicately woven in the looms of humanity, and put it under the microscope. Then put under that same microscope a rose, a lily, any flower, a daisy plucked from the common sod. The material will be like sackcloth, its edges frayed. The flower will be wonderful with all the efflorescent beauty of accuracy. God clothes the lilies, and Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  To us He has given power both to toil and to spin. How much more may we expect to be clothed by that God Who clothes the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABOLIC ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE MANIFESTO    19</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">lilies in that manner. To-day they are in the field.    To-morrow they are for burning, they are gone.   We are for the eternities, and He has given us power to toil, and to spin.</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">In these illustrations our Lord was not telling us not to think, for He did not say, Take no thought.   We were made to think, to gather, to put by in barns, to learn how to toil and spin.    Use these powers, knowing that they are given by God, and that He will co-operate with</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">us in all our gathering, in our toil, and spinning.   It is quite unnecessary therefore that we should have any anxiety about the things of necessity,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_371.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">for the supreme thing here, that flames with beauty, is that     your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.”</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The second group of illustrations concerns one subject again. The mote and the beam, and dogs and swine.    It is a curious conjunction, but they are together, and are. kept together. The mote and the beam illustrated one realm, and dogs and swine another, but they</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">are in the same possibility of action and activity in life.    The subject which our Lord was illustrating was that of the principles that are</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_372.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_373.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to actuate us in the exercise of judgment.   The word  judge  here has many meanings and applications. The Greek word is translated</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: center;">in ten or  <span class="s25">eleven </span>different ways, every one having some essential thought, but with varied applications. When our Lord said here,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_374.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_375.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Judge not that ye be not judged,” the sense in which judgment is forbidden is the judgment that condemns.   Discrimination, however, is necessary, and is enjoined.   His use of the mote and the beam shows us that we may use judgment wrongfully   and He charges us not to do that thing.  His use of the dogs and swine shows how judgment must be exercised, and is somewhat terrible in application. Judgment</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_376.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">is necessary. As John records in another connection, He said once, Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.” That was distinct instruction to exercise the power of distinction and discrimination,   That is part of our human nature. But there is a censorious attitude of soul, in which judgment deteriorates into the</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">judgment of unfairness and condemnation, and that   <span class="s25">is </span>what He forbids.  In that connection He used these startling figures of the mote and the beam.  The beam is something big, and the mote a tiny thing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_377.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The word used for beam means a great massive piece of timber.    The beam in the eye becomes almost grotesque  by its bigness  and the mote, the little chip off the beam, cannot be seen, although it causes suffering. A man sees the mote in his brother’s eye.    Jesus does not deny he may see it.  He does see it.  It is something wrong, that ought not to be there.  But Christ says there is a beam in that man’s eye who</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is looking at his brother’s mote.   The beam is not a vulgar sin.   The man guilty of a great sin is never critical of a man who has committed</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">a little sin.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Then what is the beam  <span><img width="4" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_378.gif"/></span>  That very spirit of censoriousness which is watching for something in his brother, that blinds him to all the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_379.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 136pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_380.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_381.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_382.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_383.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_384.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">facts of the case.  Sins of the spirit are always worse than the sins of the flesh  and there is no sin so blasting, so blighting, so damning, as the spirit of censorious judgment of another man.  Cast out that beam, said Jesus, get rid of that  then one will see how to take the mote out of the brother’s eye.  Censoriousness dwells upon the mote, and criticizes the brother.  That censoriousness is a beam that is blinding the man. Remove it and approach that same man in love, with the very spirit of Christ, and the brother will be helped to get rid of his mote in his eye.  Judge, not in the spirit of censorious condemnation  for we shall be judged in the way we judge  that is the measure of our judgment. Then sharply, almost suddenly, He insisted upon the necessity for discrimination.   Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the swine.”  That is a tremendous saying, and a terrible one.  If there is to be no hindering beam that prevents us from removing the mote, there is to be no blindness that prevents us from seeing corruption that is hopeless and helpless.  We are not to take precious things, and give them to dogs, to cast our pearls before the swine. Peter doubtless heard that word, and at the end of his letter he spoke of people like dogs, returning to their vomit, and sows wallowing in the mire.  There are such people, and Christ says we have</p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">no right to give such our treasure, our pearls.</p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">A tremendous application can be made of that, the necessity that the Church should guard her most holy things.  In past history the Church gave over her sacred deposit to dogs, and cast her pearls before swine when she admitted government within her borders by pagan nations.  She does it to-day whenever she compromises with the sacred things of her faith.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_385.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_386.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_387.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_388.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">The final illustrations here, the loaf, the stone  the fish, the serpent. The subject illustrated here was that of prayer, the way in which God gives as compared with the way of men, and men at their highest level, as fathers give. He had just uttered the tremendous word about freedom from censoriousness, and yet the importance of the power of discrimination that prevents handing over of sacred things to dogs and swine.

As one faces the difficulty of judging, and the fear to form any judgment, He says, The power-house is there, the light is there.   Ask, seek, knock.”  This is an ethical Manifesto. These are the laws of the Kingdom, and here prayer is enjoined as a necessity.  Has any other code of laws included prayer as a necessity</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_391.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">I think none   and that <i>is </i>why  they  all  break  down.

He will give good things.    Ask, seek, knock.” That is the dynamic centre of all ethics, because God is at the centre.   Entering into this we can find the infinite machinery, with its wheels turning, revolving  but at the centre of that wheel there is an axle, that of the heart of our Father.  Oh, do not be anxious.  Use judgment in accord- ance with the principles of God, and if we find it difficult, go into the power-house, and ask, and seek, and knock.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span><img width="13" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_399.gif"/></span> <span class="s46">Parabolic Illustrations in the M anifesto</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Matthew vi <span class="s39">and </span>vii (3)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_400.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_401.gif"/></span></p><p class="s37" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 28pt;text-align: left;">A</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">GAIN <span class="s9">we take illustrations used by our Lord on three subjects first, that of two gates and two ways   secondly, that of wolves in</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_402.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">sheep’s clothing, and fruits   and thirdly, that of rock and sand.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">In these final words of application, it would seem as though our Lord employed a crescendo, and reached a climax of illustration. <span><img width="38" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_403.gif"/></span> the first, the figure of two gates and two ways, He was speaking generally of life, and life as a pilgrimage.

It is a narrow gate and a straitened way none of the breadth of license, but the straitness of law.  But go on, and walk along it, and we find all the way it is widening, broadening, expanding with new breadth and glory and view, until at last it reaches unto life.  When Jesus said  life  He did not mean mere existence. He meant eternal life, deep life, high life, broad life, full life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_415.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Two ways of life are thus presented.  Any man reading that Sermon on the Mount has to hide himself as he stands in the light of His appalling measurements.  A man can live by high devotion of his own life to the awful law of purity, and reach the glorious clear shining of health and holiness  but he must begin at the narrow gate.  Thus the two ways of life’s pilgrimage are illustrated by the use of the gates and ways, to be interpreted in that way, and none other.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_416.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Our Lord did not say that the way of evil is broad and easy and natural, and that it would work out rightly.    Destruction” is the last word.  He did not say the narrow way would mean narrowness constantly, the cutting out of everything worth while.  No, it is the finding of everything worth <span><img width="35" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_417.png"/></span> and at Iast it is life in all its breadth and length and beauty. The narrow and straitened way leads to breadth, to life. The wide and broad way leads to narrowness, and issues in destruction.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_418.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">In close connection He used the next figure of speech.  If in the first He took His hearers to the point of beginning, the narrow and wide gates, and foretold the issue, He now brought them face to face with one of the gravest perils that would threaten them.   Beware of false prophets.”  In order to beware of them they must be tested. The subject illustrated was the testing of the prophets.  This particular subject has its supreme application to those who are called of God to prophetic work, though our Lord’s first application was not for them, but for those who wait upon their ministry and teaching.</p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">What a <span><img width="62" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_419.gif"/></span> of the false prophets. They come in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves. Our Lord was dealing here with life, not with what we call orthodoxy or heterodoxy.  These men are not those teaching a false doctrine.  They may be teaching a perfectly correct doctrine, but if in their own lives they are wrong, beware of them. This is orthodoxy, dressed in sheep’s clothing, proceeding from one who in life is a ravening wolf.  It is a perilous thing to follow such. He is now <span><img width="52" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_420.gif"/></span> those who have passed through the narrow gate along the road of progress, when they will need teachers, and guidance.  He warns such to be careful to whom they give  attention  and  allegiance.  The prophets who destroy men’s lives are those who may be dressed in sheep’s clothing, but if they are evil, their influence is destructive.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_421.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_422.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">In the next saying of Jesus the figures seem to mix, but they do not  they merge.

A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.” Mark the drastic note of His declaration,   A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.” The prophet may be in sheep’s clothing.  There may be the outward appearance, but He warned those who have entered upon the highway, through the gateway that is narrow, to take heed how they hear. They are to be careful lest they be beguiled, all <span><img width="95" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_427.gif"/></span> those who are false prophets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_428.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_429.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_430.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_431.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_432.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Our Lord then antedated the ultimate.  He looked on to the day when all life should come to consummation and manifestation and judgment.  He put Himself as Judge at the close.   In that day many will say to Me, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by Thy Name They had done many wonderful works in the Name, but He will have to say,  I never knew you.”  The peril of this halts us, and drives us not to discussion, but to heart-searching. I may prophesy in the Name.  I may cast out demons in His Name.  I may do many things in His Name  but if I do not know Him, and He does not know me personally, the last word is,   I never knew you.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_433.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_434.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The final word is,  He that doeth the will of My Father.”  That is the final test of everything.  He antedates in this figure of speech the hour when He shall appraise the life of those who are presented to Him.  There will be those who have done everything except the one thing, the will of God. As He said on another occasion, Who is My mother, who are My brethren and sisters ?  They that do the will of My Father Who is in heaven.  So He warns us to beware of false leaders, false prophets  who are to be tested by the fruit they bear.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_435.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The last of these illustrations in the Manifesto is characterized by the same attitude of majesty.  He took two figures, rock and sand, and the subject He was illustrating was the importance of foundation in building life.  It has reference to the whole Manifesto and to all the teaching that had preceded it.   Every one therefore which heareth these words of Mine.”  He had uttered the whole scheme of law in the Kingdom of God to those disciples.  Others had heard Him.

Every man is building something. He is building something into which he can go and live, that will create for him a refuge, a place of rest, a home for his soul.  The materials of the building may be correct, and as two houses go up, one cannot see any difference between them. Everything seems correct in both cases.

Christ says there are two foundations upon which we can build. If we want to build more stately mansions for the soul, watch the founda- tions.  Notice carefully the words of august majesty.  He that heareth and doeth, builds on rock.  He that heareth and doeth not, builds on sand.  It is not a comparison between a man who hears, and another who has never heard,  Those who have heard and have not obeyed, have gone on with their building, neglecting the teaching  when the storms strike, the building is destroyed.  Those who have heard, and have obeyed, and kept it, no storm that blows can destroy the house of such as have built on the teachings of Jesus.

He used this illustration to account for the absence of an ascetic attitude towards life on the part of those round about Him.  Here the disciples of John had come to Him and asked why His disciples did not fast as those of John and the Pharisees.  I believe it was a sincere question.  They had watched the disciples of Jesus, and had noticed an entire absence of ascetic practices, which they thought were of the essence of religion.  Our Lord in reply, used this figure of the marriage, an Oriental figure.  The ceremonies lasted for seven days of merriment and festivity.</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">His application was simple.  The sons of the bride-chamber never fast, or lack joy during these festivities. While the bridegroom is there, they do not fast.  Applying the illustration directly to Himself, He said that was the reason why His disciples were a happy crowd. These men could not understand why, and Jesus gave them the reason-the Bridegroom was still with them.  He then told them that presently He would be taken away, and then they would mourn.  He there used a remarkable verb. The Bridegroom will be taken and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">26    PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">caught up, a word that marks exaltation.   He was looking on to the end when He would be lifted up.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_469.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_470.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">The first part of His illustration has its application to us, but not the second.  How can the children of the bride-chamber mourn while the Bridegroom is with them    It cancels for ever anything in the nature of ascetic practices, in order to demonstrate loyalty. The absence of the Bridegroom is the reason for mourning, but He is not absent, and never has been since His victory, His resurrection, and ascension, and return in power by the Spirit to take up His abode with His own people. He was talking to His group of disciples later on in those intimate discourses, and said to them,    And ye therefore have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh away from you.”   The application here is that the true</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: center;">evidence of our relationship to Christ is our constant joy and rejoicing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_471.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: center;">0 happy day that fixed my choice,</p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: center;">On Thee, <span class="s51">my Saviour, and my God.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: right;">That is the keynote of Christian experience.

He was illustrating the nature of His Kingdom. Briefly this is what He meant   He could not crowd into an outworn formula the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_473.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">new things He was teaching men.   He had come, not to mend an old garment, but to make a new one.   Therefore  <i>new </i>methods were neces- sary  and among them were these that they could not understand, the very happiness, which was the demonstration of the new method.</p><p style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">If we put a piece of a new garment on an old, the rent is made</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_474.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_475.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">greater.  The garment cannot be mended in that way.   The illustration of the wine skins illuminates and enforces the same truth. The new demands the new.    Wine skins   is a correct translation, skins used as bottles.  Wine, when fermentation is complete, can be put into any bottles, whether new or old, without harming bottles or wine skins, and without harm to it.   Wine, intended to ferment, would burst any bottles, whether new or old. Those two statements being understood, then unfermented wine must be put into new bottles.    To put it into old bottles would produce fermentation, which is always a sign of</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">breakdown.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_476.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Thus our Lord was teaching that to put His enterprise into the old formulae would bring about decomposition and ruin. When we have taken the claim and teaching and power and work of Jesus, and have tried to press them into some other form than His, it has deterior- ated, as fermented wine. To those who objected to the merriment of His disciples He replied that the very merriment was inevitable while He was with them   and the whole system He was creating, was not something crowded into the old, but was something new.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_477.gif"/></span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">PARABOLJC ILLUSTRATIONS</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_478.gif"/></span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">We <span class="s17">come next to that marvellous figure of the harvest (ix.     38).

Matthew says that He went about all the cities and villages, teaching, preaching, and healing and when He saw the multitudes He was moved with compassion for them, for they were distressed and scattered, as sheep having no</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_482.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_483.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">shepherd. Why had He compassion on these multitudes    Because He saw them as others did not see them.   His vision of the crowd was of a multitude distressed and scattered, without a shepherd, a flock of sheep harried by the wolves, and fleeced   fainting, wounded, bleeding, dying.  It was our Lord’s picture of the condition of the multitudes,</p><p style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">in spite of their professions, and supposed orthodoxies to religion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_484.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">With that background in mind, He said harvest.    Could two more apparently contradictory figures be put together     A flock of sheep, fainting, wounded, dying, and harvest.   Here is the deep truth concern- ing His mission. Human need, distress, and dereliction constitutes harvest for Him and for His workers.   Wherever the day is darkest, wherever the need is sorest, wherever human government is at its worst, there the fields are white to harvest for the Christ of God.    So He said to His disciples before He called and commissioned them.    He knew the distressed and awful condition of humanity, but He did</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_485.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">not say it was a hopeless case   but that it was harvest, and was plenteous.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_486.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_487.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="8" height="15" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_488.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In the next illustration He spoke of sheep and wolves (x.   <span class="s52">16). </span>Again to His disciples He said,   Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves.”  Take another figure with that,   Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.”   He was illustrating now the work that lay immediately ahead of His disciples.   This tenth chapter needs careful reading.  In His commission to the twelve He saw three periods of service ahead, the immediate, then that which should follow His departure  and then beyond.  In this first period we see what was</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_489.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_490.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">before them.

Mark the   therefore.”    Be ye therefore wise as serpents, harmless as doves.” Wise as serpents. Note, it is the wisdom of the serpent, not its poisonous capacity. It is the harmlessness of the dove, not its helplessness.   Our Lord chose His words carefully to show what He meant.   His disciples were going out to serve the needs of the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_491.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 134pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sheep, into the midst of wolves.   His workers are harmless only as they are wise, and wise when they are harmless.    Any man going out upon the Master’s business who lacks wisdom, is not harmless.    Any man going out is not wise unless he is harmless.    These are the two great qualifications for going out into a hostile world, facing the wolves that have destroyed the sheep.   There are times too when His business demands our fighting with the wolves, as well as shepherding</p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">the sheep.</p><p style="padding-left: 111pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">He then used that exquisite figure of the sparrows (x.   <span><img width="40" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_492.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_493.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_494.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Talking to the same men, He was illustrating God’s tender care of His messengers.

They need the wisdom of the serpent, combined with the harmlessness of the dove.   As they go, however, the Father Who cares is with them.

When His disciples said,   Lord, behold, here are two swords,” He said,    It is enough,”  so dismissing the subject. They had failed to understand that He was emphasizing that which He had already said, that they would go out on their mission, a divisive mission.

Said He, What did you go out to the wilderness to see   Did you think you would find in the wilderness a reed, shaken by the wind   Perhaps they were thinking at that moment that John was vacillating, was being blown about by the winds sweeping over his life. A reed is always the emblem of weakness. There in the Jordan valley it was a beautiful thing to look at, often growing twenty feet in height, but it was always slender and weak, and as the winds swept across the valley the reeds were agitated, because they were unstable.  Jesus said, Is that what you went out to see   He did not answer His own enquiry, nor add anything to it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_522.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_523.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_524.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_525.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: right;">Again He said, Did you go out to see a man in soft raiment   Soft raiment was the emblem of enervation. Writing to the Corinthians Paul used that word which here is rendered   soft  raiment,” effeminate,” and that undoubtedly was its meaning. Did you go out to see a man in soft raiment ?  Here Jesus used two Greek words, in which the letters are exactly the same, differently arranged. A reed, <i>kalamos   </i>a man in soft raiment, <i>malakos.  </i>Had they gone out to see a <i>kalamos, </i>or a malakos ; a reed blown about with every breeze, or an enervated man, a man in soft raiment ? To that second suggestion</p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">He did add a most illuminative word.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_526.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 25pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Behold, they that wear soft raiment are in kings’ houses,” kings’ palaces. John was in a king’s prison. If he had been a man in soft raiment he would not have been in prison, he would have been in a palace.  Mark the satire of it.  Did you go out to see a man capable of being shaken with the wind ?  Did you go out to see a man in whose life there was a prostitution of virility for personal pleasure ?  Those familiar with John would know no reed was he, no effeminate dilettante, hanging on at the courts of kings for the gratification of their lusts. The very suggestion was enough. They went out to see a prophet, but he was far more than a prophet.  So with great dignity our Lord defended John from the possibility of misunderstanding.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_527.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">We gather therefore that there are two characteristics that dis- qualify any man for prophetic work.  What are they   Weakness that yields to every passing wind that blows, or such self-indulgence as can be expressed only when they wear soft raiment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_528.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">When Jesus had defended John, He talked about the generation in the midst of which He was doing His work.  In this figure of the children playing in the market-place, the subject He was illustrating was that of the unreasonableness of that age.  It was a homely and beautiful figure.  There He was in the cities of the twelve, while they were on their mission, preaching   and He suddenly illustrated the fact that His preaching, and the preaching of John, whom He had just defended,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 147pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABOLIC  ILLUSTRATIONS         <span><img width="15" height="20" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_529.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">was preaching to an age that was characterized by its unreasonableness. I think this might also be applied to this age in which we are living.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_530.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">What is the figure    Children playing at marriages and funerals. Children were playing in the streets, in the market-place, probably at setting sun, when market was over, and the day was waning, and the bairns were getting tired.   Some of them wanted to play at a wedding, and the others would not.   Then they changed, and they said, Let us play then at a funeral. No, they would not do that.    You will not mourn to John’s wailing, and you will not dance to My piping.    John came with the stern, hard, ascetic and profoundly necessary message, calling men to repentance, and you say he has a demon, and you will</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">not listen.   I have come with such humanness that men say of Me, I am a <span><img width="60" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_531.gif"/></span> Man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.   It was the age that would not mourn to John’s wailing, and would not dance to Jesus’ piping.    Or we could turn that round, and say this, John would not dance to their piping, and Jesus would not mourn to their wailing. It was an unreasonable age. The harder, sterner, severer note was denounced as being the utterance of a man who was demon-possessed. The tender, human, and happy note of</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Jesus was refused because it lacked the ascetic note.   John lacked the human touch, and they said he had a demon.   Jesus seemed to lack the harder and the ascetic outlook on life, and they said, Do not listen</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_532.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_533.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: justify;">to Him, He is a gluttonous Man and a winebibber.

Wisdom knows the necessity for the real reason of mourning, and the true inspiration of dancing, and she is justified in her methods as they are presented to men.</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Again in this twelfth chapter, verses eleven and twelve, we have that simple figure of speech of a sheep fallen into a pit on the Sabbath</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">day.  What was the subject our Lord was illustrating ?   Many applica- tions can be made of it, but here He was showing the dishonesty of traditionalism, the dishonesty of these men of His own time who were traditionalists.   In that same chapter when passing through the corn- fields, the question was raised, and now again when He healed a man</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">on the Sabbath, Luke shows that it was on another Sabbath, but Matthew puts the two incidents close together.    It was the Sabbath, and the traditionalists’ attitude towards the Sabbath was marked by</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">their question about the disciples, and the question of what Jesus would do on the Sabbath.  What He did to that cripple gave rise to the figure of speech.</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">We know how constantly our Lord flung Himself against the bondage of traditionalism because it overlay the law of God.    What a distinction He drew.   They taught for commandments of God the traditions of men, and neglected the great matters of the law.     Go back to that age.   They had the law of God as it had come to them</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_537.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 136pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">through Moses, the written law in their Scriptures.  To that they had added the oral law.  Now the oral law consisted of interpretations of the written law by the Great Synagogue, that was called Abhoth, which  means  Fathers.  The opinions of the Fathers constituted tradi- tion laid upon them, and were attempts to interpret the actual law. Again, from these traditions which they called Abhoth, they had another section called Toldoth, and Toldoth meant descendants. These were rules deduced from the interpretations of the Fathers, supposedly resulting from the law itself.  The result was tradition heaped upon tradition, which had bound upon the people intolerable burdens.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_538.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_539.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: left;">Take this matter of the Sabbath, in illustration.  The law said that on the Sabbath there should be no manner of work.  The Abhoth, or the Fathers, in this application said, Reaping and threshing are both work  therefore reaping and threshing must not take place on the Sabbath. Then going down to Toldoth, they said, Plucking the ears of corn with the hand is reaping, and rubbing them is threshing. That is why the Pharisees objected to what the disciples were doing.  Their secondary interpretation of the law was that if the disciples plucked ears of corn and rubbed them, they were breaking the law, they were reaping and threshing. It is very natural, and quite possible. People even to-day are mastered by tradition <span class="s32">in </span>stupid matters, and in religion something the fathers said, which was said sincerely, and the sons have come along and taken what the fathers said, and they have added something to it, and the result has been all manner of futile, stupid, ridiculous laws governing men.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_540.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_541.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="24" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_542.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_543.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_544.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">These Pharisees were criticizing Jesus, and wondering what He would do on the Sabbath with the crippled man  and He said, Which of you, having a sheep fallen into a pit on the Sabbath day, would not draw it out.  Many of them, if they had seen a sheep that had fallen into a pit, would not have drawn it out on the Sabbath  but if the sheep had been their own, they would <span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_545.gif"/></span>  That is the whole point. Which of    having one of your own sheep fallen into a pit, would you not pull it out on the Sabbath   How much more is a man better than a sheep  This man is God’s property. The sheep is yours. You have one law which you observe for your own personal property, and another that you observe for God’s property.  A sheep, if it is yours, you would deliver.  A man, if he is God’s man afflicted, you say the Sabbath is broken if he is delivered.  The final application was that He took the man and He healed him.  The man because the property of God was sacred, and was restored to sanctity as Jesus healed him.

An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign.”  Evil, <span><img width="45" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_560.gif"/></span> harmful   and adulterous, faithless marking their relationship to God, appearing in the figures of the Old Testament of the betrothal of God’s people to Himself. Jesus told these rulers, asking Him for a sign, calling Him Teacher, while not obeying what He had to say, asking in mockery for some spectacular sign from heaven; I know the meaning of your question. You are evil, and you are adulterous.  The effect of your life upon others is harmful, because you are out of harmony with God, and are infidel. There is no sign that shall be given to you except the sign of the prophet Jonah., for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish, so shall the Son of man be three days and nights in the heart of the earth.  The Scriptures never say whale, but a   great fish.” Some men are so busy with the tape measure trying to find out whether a man could get inside a fish, they never plumb the depths of Deity. The book of Jonah says that   God prepared a great fish.” Jonah was a sign to Nineveh.  There is no meaning in that sign if the story was not true.  It demands the historicity of the story of Jonah.  How was Jonah a sign to Nineveh   The crew of the vessel had flung him overboard reluctantly. Undoubtedly they were a fine body of men. They did not want to do so, but he was insistent.  To them he was dead, and gone.  Then they reached the land, and the man they had flung to death appeared in Nineveh, preaching.

The answer He gave those rulers was,   Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”   That is exactly the same thing.

This was a great word He uttered.   Whether anyone caught the significance of it at the time we do not know    but there remains the record for us, and for all time, to show that the spectacular thing these men wanted He never granted    and indeed, so evident is it, that during His ministry, repeatedly when some miracle had been wrought, out of His compassion of heart, He charged people not to talk about it.</p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">The last illustration is in verses forty-three to forty-five. It is important to notice that whatever the illustration was, the application was to that generation.   That does not exclude an application of it to personal and individual lives.   He was, however, speaking to that generation, in the midst of which He had been conducting His ministry, following upon that of John.   The whole of John’s ministry, and that of Jesus, had had the effect of casting out of evil spirits.     It was a cleansing, purifying, exorcising ministry. That was what our Lord was illustrating. He took this story of a house which had become</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_564.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tenantless.   The whole emphasis in His description of that house was His account of how the returning demon found it.     He findeth it empty, swept and garnished.” Yes, but empty. He was speaking of His generation, an evil generation, swept and garnished by the teaching</p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">of His predecessor and His own teaching, but not possessed, empty. He was emphasizing the fact that if that or any other generation is left like that, it may become the home of demons sevenfold. The illustration is that of the danger of a tenantless house.</p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The application was to that generation. The house was freed from evil mastery for a while, but it was empty.   It lacked a new possessor. It lacked a master in place of the one exorcised and the empty house was the opportunity for the re-entry of the demon, reinforced seven- fold.  We must take it, and make application of it to ourselves, or to an age. Reformation without regeneration is no use. Oh, we may sweep the house, and garnish it, and improve certain conditions by creating a new environment but unless there is a new possessor, a new Lord, a new Master, instead of the old demon, the demons will return with sevenfold force. Reformation is ultimately of no value alone.</p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is only preparation for worse desolation.   The only possible cure for a man or an age is reformation, followed by regeneration and the incoming of the new Lord and Master. That is so with the individual.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 158pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4">THE GENERAL SCHEME          </a><span class="s29">35</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="7."><p class="s49" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: center;">The General Scheme</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_565.gif"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Matthew</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="21" height="23" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_566.gif"/></span></p><p class="s55" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">HIS <span class="p">chapter contains at some length our Lord’s explanation of His reason for using the parabolic method, and it is of vital importance</span></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">and interest.  Chronologically in the ministry of Jesus the record in this chapter marks a stage in that ministry when our Lord turned largely to the parabolic method when dealing with the multitudes, employing it also with His own disciples.  This chapter contains eight parables, all delivered on the same occasion, though not as one set discourse. That fact is proven by the fifty-third verse. This study then is of the nature of a general survey, important to a more detailed consideration.</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">At the seaside Jesus gave the first complete parable, that of the sower, and He gave an explanation of that parable in answer to the request of His disciples, doubtless also given in the hearing of the  multitudes.  Following that explanation, He uttered three other parables, still by the seaside, sitting in the boat, while the multitudes thronged the shore.  At the thirty-sixth verse we see that He left the multitudes, and went into the house.  The first thing that happened in the house was that again, in answer to the request of His disciples, He explained one of the parables, the second that He had uttered in public.  Then He gave to them, in the house, four other parables.</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">To take a general survey.  We find in these parables the King’s own view of His Kingdom as to its history in the age which He had then initiated. These parables, pictures, stories reveal His view of the Kingdom, not in its eternal and abiding sense, but in its history in the age which He had initiated by His coming into the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="2" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_567.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="10" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_568.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_569.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_570.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_571.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: right;">The first of these parables simply reveals the nature of His mission, is the parable of the sower.  The second parable begins with the words,   The Kingdom of heaven is likened unto.”  The first parable has no such reference, and He never again used this particular phrase in this chapter, but said,   The Kingdom of heaven is like.”  Here in the second parable the phrase might be rendered, The Kingdom of heaven has become like.  In that introduction the phrase shows our Lord was thinking of the Kingdom of heaven as an abiding fact, but one that changed in its conditions and in its expression.  The Kingdom of heaven has become like   there was a change through His own</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">coming, and He shows the nature of the change.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_572.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Then the next five parables, two uttered in public and three in private, all begin,  The Kingdom of heaven is like.” Here is the general character of the change, and the result thereof. These are the pictures of a definite period.  The limit is found in two verses, thirty-nine and</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span><img width="13" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_573.gif"/></span>    <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_574.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">forty-nine, when our Lord spoke of the end of the age, not of the world, an unhappy translation.  When some people talk of the end of the world they mean a cataclysm, an annihilation, and a ceasing to be.  That is not what our Lord meant.  He spoke of  the consum- mation of the age.”  A period of time was in His view.</p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Our Lord spoke here to illumine, not to becloud, to illustrate, and <span class="s41">to </span>lure men towards the mystery through the symbol. Therefore these parables should be considered on the simplest level. Taking the symbols, and mastering them, we touch the sublime.</p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The second canon is that the application should be restricted to the period of time which was in view.  To fail to do that is to fail to understand what our Lord was intending to teach. They are pictures of one age, beginning with His first advent, and ending with His second advent, of the period in which we are living to-day. This restric- tion of application will save us from stupid blunders being made to-day about the work of the Church, and of the condition of the world.</p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Again in studying the figurative teaching of Jesus, we find His consistent use of such figurative terms. They are never mixed. I would go further and say that applies to the whole Bible. The  figurative language of the Bible is always consistent with basic principles.</p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">In our general survey of these parables in this chapter, the Kingdom is viewed in its progress in this age among men.  Those spoken to the multitude present the Kingdom process from the human viewpoint. In the second group of parables, spoken to the disciples, the same age is in view, but the Kingdom is seen from the Divine aspect.</p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">In the first four parables, those presenting the human viewpoint, our Lord described two antagonistic forces at work in human history. He not only referred to these forces, but He made it perfectly clear that there would be long and continuous conflict between them. Taking those four parables, the apparent issue is the victory of evil, on the earth level, and the human standpoint. Remember, He was looking at the processes of the Kingdom as He saw them, and portraying God’s vision of that period.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_575.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_576.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">In the parable of the sower and the seed, the work of the King is seen, scattering men of the Word in order to produce Kingdom results. Sons of the Kingdom are scattered, in whom the Word is incarnate, so as to produce Kingdom results  and the results of victory seem to be very small  for there is the work of the enemy, the injury of the seed through the soil, to prevent the fruit of the Kingdom.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="27" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_577.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">In the next parable there are two sowings. Again the King is the Sower, sowing His field with the sons of the Kingdom.  At the same time the work of the enemy is that of sowing the field with sons of the evil one. Wheat and darnel, that weed of the East so     in its growth to wheat that experts can hardly detect the difference in its early  stage.</p><p style="padding-left: 111pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">In the third parable the Kingdom is presented as a mustard tree,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 160pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE GENERAL SCHEME          <span class="s33">3 7</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">an unnatural growth, a manifestation of earthly greatness which is not in harmony with the intention of the King, in the false values that will be manifested.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_578.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Once more, the leaven in the meal, the introduction of a principle of  decomposition  and  disintegration,  with  the  result  of  external corruption  and  paralysis.  Those are our Lord’s four pictures of Kingdom processes, spoken to the crowds  and that view harmonizes with the history of nineteen hundred years, and all the newspapers of to-morrow morning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_579.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">When we turn to the second group of parables, after He had <span class="s41">gone </span>into the house, we find Him talking to the men immediately round Him, who were to be responsible for His enterprise in the world, and He was showing them the Kingdom as viewed from the Divine stand- point.  Here the one activity running through them all, and in every case the complete success of that activity, both in the ending of the age which He was initiating, and in the processes of the Kingdom which He was describing.  Then that which in evil had seemed to be victorious is destroyed   and that which has been the purpose of the King is brought to a glorious finality and realization.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_580.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The parable of the treasure in the field, the latent possibilities of the field. The field is the world.  There is the purchase of the whole field at cost.  That is the Divine attitude.  The pearl in the field, with its latent possibilities, and amid the treasure, one supreme treasure and there is a personal sacrifice in order to secure possession of that treasure.  Again that is the Divine outlook.

That is the method of the age, and all conditions of people are included therein, all sorts of fishes  but there is a final discrimination.  In each case when referring to the consummation, or final discrimination, our Lord shows the finality will be supernatural. It will not be in men’s hands at all, but in the hands of angels.  Angels are the reapers.  Angels pull in the net and sort the fishes.

They evidently understood in such a measure as to make it possible for Christ to utter one more parable, showing their responsi- bilities about all these things, as scribes, instructed to the Kingdom of heaven.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="1" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_591.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_592.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It was a great day when He began uttering parables    four to the crowds, and four to His own.  The first four revealed the processes of the Kingdom through an age, on the human level.   Three revealed the processes of the Kingdom from the Divine viewpoint, of the Divine purpose and standard   and the final one showed the responsibility of His own in view of that view of the Kingdom.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">If any should believe that the whole world is to be converted and changed, and presently be transformed as the result of their work, they are blind. Christ is against such a belief, History is against it. The</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">activities in the world to-day are against it.   When we see this move- ment through this age from the Divine standpoint, then the heart is at rest as to the issue.   The final parable here reveals the importance of the fact that we are scribes, instructed in the Kingdom of heaven.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">We must have the Master’s conception if we are to serve the Kingdom without fret, without fever, without failing in quiet calm strength.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="8."><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 213pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;">The Sower</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 167pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Matthew  xiii <span><img width="26" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_593.png"/></span> and 18-23</p><p class="s50" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 26pt;text-align: left;">T</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 105pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">HE FIRST <span class="p">parable of the Sower is one of two which our Lord Himself  explained.

There are neither roads, nor thorns, nor stony places in such lots.  He must go forth into the open country as these have done, where there are no fences    where the path passes through cultivated land where thorns grow in clumps all around    where the rocks peep out in places through the scanty soil    and where also, hard by, are patches extremely  fertile.

There are four things in the story as Jesus told it that arrest attention   first, the sower  secondly, the seed  thirdly, the soil and, lastly, the sequence.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_611.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_612.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Then we are concerned with our Lord’s explanation of the picture. Notice that the sower is not named.  He began bluntly,   Behold, a sower went forth to sow.”  It was an actual fact, but so far as the teaching is concerned, He did not name the sower, neither did He do so in His explanation.  He did not say who the sower was who sowed the seed. However, going to the thirty-seventh verse we read this. When the disciples asked Him to explain the parable of the tares, He said,  He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man.”  That applie equally to this parable of the sower.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_613.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Notice in the next place that the chief value of the picture is the seed and its relation to the soil.  These things are foundation principles, to be borne in mind as we approach the detailed study of these wonder- ful parables. The sower is not referred to, but unquestionably the Lord was referring to Himself as He said,   He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_614.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Then again, bear in mind there is one Sower, and one soil.  The Sower is the Son of man.  What is the soil   He does not name it. The hard highway, the thorns, the rock, do not constitute soil.  The ground does.  If we would know what the soil is once again we trespass upon the next parable.  Following the statement in verse thirty-seven,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_615.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 129pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_616.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_617.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 7pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">He that soweth good seed is the Son of man,” He says,    and the field is the world.”  Let us keep that carefully in mind.</p><p style="padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">We are next impressed by the fact that there are various conditions</p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">of the seed, and various responses of the soil.   As our Lord explained His parable, when He referred to the seed, He did so by speaking of</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: -7pt;text-align: left;">persons.   These words of explanation are found, beginning at the nineteenth verse,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_618.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 21pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">When any one heareth the word of the Kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the evil one, and snatcheth away that which hath</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_619.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_620.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="23" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_621.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 121pt;text-indent: -29pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">been sown in his heart.

He employs the masculine pronoun which covers all human souls.   The seed then, as viewed at this point, must be considered in that way.   There are varied responses made by the soil, and those responses depend upon the condition of the seed that is sown in the soil.   That will become plainer as we proceed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_623.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_624.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_625.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Take the first.    <span class="s25">He </span>that was sown by the wayside.”   Mark the emphasis.

Some may be inclined to say there is a contradiction between the incidence of the teaching in the story and that of the explanation.   As a matter of fact, there is no difference or disparity. In the former, emphasis is laid upon the soil. In the latter, the emphasis  <i>is </i>laid upon the nature of the seed that falls upon the soil. The seed sown, as we have seen, are men and women. But behind that sowing of human life in the world, with Kingdom intention, there is another sowing, that of the Word in the heart.    Turning to Luke’s account, there it is seen clearly that the sowing of the Word in the heart of the individuals is the first thing. That being so, these individuals, men and women are sent out into the world, the very seed</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_640.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">of the Kingdom. The ultimate seed is the Word itself.   The world is the field, to which we come again  and the planting of that field is of men and women in whom the Word of God has been planted.   Men and women fructified by the implanted Word, become seeds of the Kingdom</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">in world affairs.</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The soil is always the same. The figures employed by our Lord simply describe the response made to it.   To men who hear the Word, but do not understand, the soil is unreceptive.

He had given His explanation of the parable of the Sower to the listening crowds.

They asked Him to explain to them   the parable of the tares of the field.”  That shows that as they listened, they had been impressed supremely by that element of the story that Jesus had told them.  They did not ask Him to explain the parable of the two sowings, though that must have surprised them. Evidently the Lord intended to lay stress upon the fact of the darnel, or tares. Darnel was the word used, and the Lord had spoken of darnel being sown.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_646.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_647.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_648.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Again there are three things to do  first, to take the picture as our Lord gave it to them simply as a picture in its Eastern setting and surroundings  secondly, to pay attention to our Lord’s explanation finally gathering up the instruction for ourselves.</p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The picture is of a field in which there were two sowings.  It is the picture also of the method of the owner of the field in face of the fact of the two sowings. This picture is Eastern. Notice that the field was the property of the man sowing good seed, and not of the enemy who sowed darnel.  Whatever was intended by the field, we are looking at an Eastern picture of a field which was the property of one man. It was his field.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_649.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_650.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Then there were the two sowings.  The first was perfectly simple and natural, in the true order of things.  The owner of the field sowed his field with harvest in view, that what he sowed should bring forth harvest was natural and proper.  It was a picture of something going on year after year  a man owned a field, and in the field that was his, he cast seed, intending thereby to produce a definite kind of harvest. Then came the amazing part of the story that Jesus told.  An enemy came, an enemy of the man and of the purpose of the owner of the field, and of his intention for the harvest upon which his mind was set when he sowed the seed. An enemy sowed with the distinct intention of spoiling the harvest.  There is no need to argue that this was unnatural   it was improper, it was dastardly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_651.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">What was it he sowed   Darnel, that is, something which in its first springing from the ground even experts cannot detect from wheat.</p><p style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">Darnel is sown, and the wheat is sown, and presently when the showers come, and they begin to sprout, the difference between them could not be  detected.  Darnel is like wheat, but it is actually entirely different from wheat. It is of a different nature. Looking like wheat when it first springs, as it develops and grows the difference becomes increasingly manifest, until when it has come to full growth, no one could make any mistake, or fail to distinguish between the wheat and the darnel. An enemy sowed the field already sown ‘with wheat, with something that imitated it. Evidently the enemy then was a trespasser, who had no right on that field at all.  He was full of subtlety, and came</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_652.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">while men slept.”  He was an enemy, animated by malice.</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Then the servants of the owner came to him, and told him what had been going on.  Evidently when the manifestation was beginning to be clear as to the difference, they had found out that what they</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE DARNEL             <span class="s59">43</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_653.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">thought was wheat only was wheat and darnel.  They  came  perturbed to the master to tell him someone had sown darnel in his wheat field. “ An enemy has done this,” he replied. What shall we do then, master   Shall we go through this wheat field and gather out all the tares, this darnel? No, leave them alone until the harvest. Then no one will make any mistake as to the difference between them.  Do not try to uproot the tares, because you may not be sure, and may uproot wheat, when you think you are gathering tares. At the con- summation of the age, at the harvest time the whole field will be dealt with. Then there will be discrimination according to manifestation. That is the story.</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: right;">Presently, after Jesus had uttered two other brief but pregnant parables, they went into the house, and the disciples said to Him,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_654.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_655.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 10pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.

Thus inferentially our Lord was claiming definitely that the whole world belonged to Him,  That is a philosophy of all life and service that we should remember. Many years ago now I was in the Isle of Man, and was listening to a sermon by a local preacher in a Wesleyan Chapel.  He said something so full of simplicity that it fastened itself upon my memory.  I have never lost the power of it.  He said,  The devil is a squatter.”  That arrested attention.  He did not leave his congregation in the dark.  He knew something of life in America,’ and he went on and said,   A squatter is a man who settles on land he has <i>no </i>right to, and works it for his own  advantage.”  Can the theologians give a better definition of the devil than that   That lies behind this word of Jesus,   The field is the  world.”    is the property, not of the one who is sowing evil seeds in it, but the property of the One Who according to this aspect of the Kingdom, is sowing good seed in the whole world.  In Mark’s account of the missionary commission, Jesus said,  Go ye into all the cosmos, and preach the Gospel to every creature.”  That is the same word, cosmos, the whole world, the world in itself, in its order of life, its peopling,   all the world.”  When Paul wrote his letter to the Romans, he said,   The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now,” waiting   for the revealing of the sons of God.” When he wrote that stupendous thing he was surely thinking of this parable  the world, the field, groaning, waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God.  Undoubtedly he was referring to the second Advent, and that is the ultimate fulfilment.  But it is also true to-day. What this world everywhere in its sighing and sobbing and sorrow is needing is the manifestation of the sons of God.</p><p style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">The inferential claim of our Lord must be recognized.

The way to its realization in the midst of a derelict world, and of a blasted and broken race, is that He as the Sower is flinging out into the world, in its order and conditions, in its lack of order and chaos, seed.  What is the seed ?  The seed is the sons of the Kingdom, in His own field.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_675.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_676.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_677.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="20" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_678.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">But He said, Another sowing is going on at the same time.  Who is the sower   Here our Lord used the word for Satan, <i>diabolos, </i>the traducer, the Iiar.  He named him as the one who is against every thing that is true, and high and noble.  Said Jesus, He is busy in My field, sowing his seed. What seed    Sons of the evil,” men and women who are devoted, not to God, but to evil  evil men and women flung into the world order. But there is a peculiar quality about his sowing. He is sowing his seed among the wheat, and the two prepositions are close together, emphasising one another,    <i>meson, </i>showing that the idea is of a sowing so near to something else, so much like it, as to create widespread deception. That is what the enemy is doing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_679.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_680.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_681.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_682.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_683.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="38" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_684.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="32" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_685.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">What shall we do   If we are the sons and servants of the King and the Kingdom, shall we go out, and root up these evil seeds   Let them alone, said Jesus. Let both alone  let the wheat alone  let the darnel alone.  Till when   Till the harvest, till the consummation, till that hour which must inevitably come when the true deep meaning of every human life comes into clear manifestation.  He was looking on to a consummation, and He said, Harvest will be the consummation of the age, when the difference will be patent, and when, knowing that hour of      has come, He will deal with the      situation by supernatural agency. Angels will be introduced into national affairs, and there will be two harvests.  The angels will gather out of His Kingdom everything that is harmful, everything that is wrong, and cast it out to the destruction of fire.

The world is getting better every day, and worse every day. There are two sowings, two growths, two increasing manifestations. Evil to-day is more deadly, more damnable, more dastardly than it has ever been in the history of the world. Good to-day <i>is </i>more pronounced, more definite. There are more signs everywhere of it than there have ever been.  Both are growing, growing, growing, and presently the harvest will come. We do not know when.</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Mark what this parable teaches quite clearly.  The method of the foe in this age is principally that of imitation.  Those who are definitely hostile, and blatantly declare so, are not in view in this parable.  I am not saying the devil has nothing to do with them, but that is not his method.  It is not his most subtle method.  It is not the method most productive of harm in the world.  It is imitation. Go back to Acts. Ananias and Sapphira were both members of the outward and visible Church.  Simon <span><img width="36" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_688.gif"/></span> was also active in the work of the Church.  See the writings, and the same thing is evident. What the apostle combated was not the harm of definite opposition, or the massed opposition of godlessness in the pagan world, but that principle, so much like Christianity, darnel, which at the beginning looked like wheat. That has gone on all down the ages.  The elements of imitation have been found, so that the Church came to rejoice in a false power, which was entirely antagonistic to her very genius and life, and even to indulge in a false form of supposed purity, which consisted in abstention from trivial things, while the weightier matters were neglected in the depth of her life.</p><p style="padding-left: 81pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">To-day we are seeing it in the realm of doctrine, accommodation,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_689.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">to supposed modern thought, in which some men are using the phrasing of Christianity, devitalized, and devoid of the fundamental <span><img width="48" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_690.gif"/></span><span class="s29"> </span>imitation.

Let  it  alone,  resting assured that the hour of actual manifestation is coming.  If we begin trying to root up the darnel we are in danger of rooting up wheat, and the process of development can do no harm to the good, and the process of development means always moving towards final judgment for the evil.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_692.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="21" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_693.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_694.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Here for the first time our Lord pointed to the consummation of the age.

In this consideration we may well remind ourselves that there are things implicit here, but not explicit. There are other things to be said about the age than was said in this parable.  A man who is a son of evil, and is planted in this field of the world, darnel, can do what no darnel can do in the realm of Nature.  He can have his nature changed and become a son of the Kingdom. That is where the Gospel comes in.  The Gospel is implicit here, and it is well to remember it. A man who but yesterday, planted by Satan in the midst of commerce, of society, or recreation, exerting an evil influence, and hindering the Kingdom of God  blessed be God, can be changed, and become a son of the Kingdom, and begin to exert the influence with others, towards the coming of the Kingdom of God.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_697.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Our business then is to grow, to develop, and so to <span><img width="26" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_698.gif"/></span> the purpose of our Lord in our own lives, and thus to hasten the coming of His Kingdom  and never to attempt to pull up darnel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 184pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">IO <span class="s26">.

That of the sowing of the darnel, was given in private to His disciples.</p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">When approaching such a parable, there are two perils to be avoided, in interpretation.  One is that of popularity, and the other is that of misinterpretation of history, in an attempt to understand the parable.  We have no right to come to this, or any parable, influenced by the general consensus of expository opinion. Here I would lay down a principle for all Bible study.  Whatever  the  popular  interpreta- tion may be, it is not therefore necessarily the correct one.  It may be correct, but popularity <span class="s25">is </span>not  any  guarantee  of  accuracy.  That needs  no  arguing.  The  acceptation  of  popular  interpretation  of Scripture led to the crucifixion of Jesus.</p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Then there is a danger of considering history from the standpoint of observation, and interpreting these parables of Jesus by the facts of history as we know them.  That too may be a perilous procedure against which we need to guard.</p><p style="padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">There are general principles of interpretation which must he</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 163pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE MUSTARD SEED           <span><img width="18" height="20" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_699.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">observed.   The first is that of the harmony of the teaching of Jesus throughout these parables. Referring now  only to those parables contained in this thirteenth chapter of Matthew, we must bear in mind that there is perfect harmony in the general conception and teaching of Jesus throughout.</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">In the second place, we must bear in mind the consistency of our Lord’s figures of speech.   He never used one in two different senses. They are all used consistently in the same way.</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">To apply these canons of interpretation, the popular conception of this particular parable is that our Lord predicted the great success of the Kingdom. Almost invariably the parable of the mustard seed that became a tree is treated as though our Lord was showing the complete and ultimate success of the Kingdom in this age.   We must not forget that all these parables have to do with one age.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">That view, however, has been distinctly disproved by history. There has been growth, but it has been unsatisfactory.   We talk to-day of the Kingdom of God, and of Christian nations.   There are no Christian nations.  There are nations that profess to be founded upon Christian principles, but there are no Christian nations.   We are not a Christian  nation.  The principles of a Christian nation have never yet been put to the test, and proven, and revealed to the world in national life. There has been a growth in Kingdom understanding, and the application of Kingdom principles, but nothing approaching complete</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">success.  On the contrary, there is very much that denies success.</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Another principle to be observed is that of the harmony of teaching. Throughout all these parables these things of difficulty, limitation, opposition, and admixture were evidently foretold by our Lord. There is not one parable that moves to a consummation of the age resulting from the activities in the age.   The idea that the Gospel is to be preached until all the world is converted, is a mistaken one, if we believe in Jesus, and in what He said.   There is nothing that suggests such a result in any of these parables.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_700.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">To take the figures recurring in all those parables at which we have been looking  the sowing of the seed, and the seed, the Word of God incarnate in human lives, the sons of the Kingdom.    The Sower Who sowed the seed is the Son of man.   The soil, the field in which the seed is sown, is the world.   The birds are symbolic of evil, that come and snatch away the seed.   These figures are consistent.</p><p style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Let us then look at this parable with unprejudiced and open mind.</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">So we will examine the picture, and apply the teaching.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_701.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">The picture Jesus drew was of a seed, the smallest of all seeds, which seed grew until it became a tree.   Normally the mustard seed never becomes a tree.  The mustard is a herb, not a tree.   As a tree it has been described as    a garden shrub outdoing itself.” That is abnormality. All attempts to make the tree square with popular interpretation is of the nature of special pleading.

But even Dr. Thomson evades this, or tries to account for it.  Writing from Palestine, and from his own observation, he plainly says that the mustard there was not a tree, and did not grow to a tree.  He then says possibly in our Lord’s time there was another variety of mustard that grew to be a tree.  I have quoted the spirit of what he says. Others have tried in other ways to account for <span class="s39">it.

Our Lord said   A great tree <span><img width="13" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_709.png"/></span>  and He also said that this particular mustard seed grew greater than all the herbs, of which it is one. Dr. Royle, another writer, suggests that the reference was to Khardal, or <span class="s60">Salvadora     </span>But Dr. Morrison has declared there is no proof of the growth of either of these specimens in that neighbourhood. Our Lord was surely teaching that in this age there would be an abnormal and unnatural growth of the mustard seed, so that it would afford as a tree, a lodging for the birds of the air.  The word means a camping in it, and living in it.  The parable was never intended to teach the progress and growth of the Kingdom to finality in this age.  It does mark development, but it is abnormal development.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_710.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_711.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_712.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">To turn from the picture that Jesus drew to mark the unnatural development of the Christian principle and ideal, as taught by Him.

These are the things that mark the true Christian spirit, emanating from those in whom the Word of God is incarnate, and who are flung out into the age as the seed of the Kingdom. The marks of true Christianity are always those of likeness to Him Who said,   I am meek and lowly in heart <span><img width="12" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_713.png"/></span> likeness to Him Who said,   The Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_714.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_715.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">What  are  the  unnatural  notes   Exactly  the  opposite  of  the natural   loftiness, pride, dominance.

Yes, the Church has grown in loftiness.  It has often become so powerful that it has become proud, and has sought dominion over others.  All these things are the outcome not of normal, but of abnormal growth.  As we look down the history of the age, so far we shall see the truth  illustrated.  It began when those first disciples when Jesus was with them, said,  Who is greatest in the Kingdom of heaven   There was the passion for prominence, position, and power. We know how He answered that. He told them that only those who were prepared to drink His cup, and be baptized with His baptism were great in the Kingdom of heaven.  The early Church had illustrations of it.  Peter, in his letter, charged them not to lord it over God’s heritage.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_731.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_732.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">The supreme illustration of this abnormal growth was in the espousal of Christianity by Constantine, the Roman emperor. That was the darkest day that dawned in all the history of the Church. His espousal of Christianity was an astute and clever political move, and he grafted upon Christianity much of paganism, and elevated it to a position of wordly power   and in that hour the whole Church passed under the blight from which it has never completely escaped. That is the whole sin and wrong of the Papacy, domination won in the name of Christ, the claiming of power to rule over kings, emperors, and rulers and dictate terms to them   a great tree, spreading its branches.  That spirit remains in every attempt even to-day, to realize the Divine purpose by high organization, vested power. It is not a good thing. It is an abnormal growth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_733.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_734.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">It has gone on, and is still going on.  Christ said it would, and the unintended issue has been the false greatness of external position and power, a great tree.  The tree is always the symbol of greatness and authority. Nebuchadnezzar was likened to a tree. Pharaoh with all his power was likened to a tree  and the Kingdom of heaven has become like that, a great worldly power, principality occupied with its loftiness, the expressing of itself in pride, seeking dominion, or domina- tion in the affairs of the world  and consequently it has become the refuge of unclean things.  Such the parable, and its teaching.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_735.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="22" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_736.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="23" height="6" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_737.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Again we must remember that in these parables our Lord was not dealing with the true nature of the Kingdom.

Not in one of these parables was He revealing the inward nature of the Kingdom, except at the beginning, when He showed that the Kingdom principles are found in the Word of God, as it is embodied in the lives of Christian men and women. That, of course, includes everything, but there is no detailed reference to it in interpretation.  The ethics of the Kingdom are not found here in detail.  They are found in the Sermon on the Mount.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_740.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_741.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_742.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="41" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_743.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="14" height="2" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_744.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_745.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_746.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 105pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">This is of great importance, for our Lord was not revealing the nature of the ultimate issue.  Twice He referred to that issue in this chapter clearly and distinctly   but there is no detailed description. He was depicting Kingdom processes during one age of Divine pro- cedure.  This is not the only age.  It will come to consummation  but the work of God will not end with its consummation.  There are other methods of God predicted in the Word of God, following the ending of this age are other ages, the Kingdom of the Son, and beyond that the hour when Paul says,  Then      the end, when He shall deliver up the Kingdom to God    that God may be all and in all.”  What lies beyond that who shall tell   Paul wrote of the great procession of the ages in those descriptive words of infinite poetry,   the generation of the age of the ages.”  God is not exhausted in this age. He has others to come, the details of which are not revealed, but the fact is declared.</p><p style="padding-left: 105pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Christ was in no doubt about the happenings of this age.  There should be the sowing of the seed, its scattering far and wide.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_747.gif"/></span></p><p class="s48" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 186pt;text-indent: -2pt;text-align: center;">Sow in the <span class="s51">morn </span>thy seed, At eve hold not thy hand.”</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 104pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">Said Christ, That seed will be sown by the Sower, but only a portion will be fruitful. There will be the scattering of seed that bears no fruit. He suffered no delusion. He did not say that the seed being planted, a complete and perfect harvest would result. He saw an enemy scattering amid the seed, damel.  He saw that the age must run on with the development of wheat and darnel, until the con- summation of the age.  So here He saw the growth, out of life, but abnormal.  A herb becomes a great tree, and the fowls of the air lodge in its branches.</p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 103pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">What is <span class="s51">the bearing of this parable on us ?  It calls us to a recogni- tion of the facts of the age in which we live.  That will save us from the delusion that so often fills the minds of honest souls with despair. </span>We <span class="s51">thought it would have been so different, that the Kingdom principles were  winning.  We thought that was so, with a certain measure of arrogance, at the close of the nineteenth century and on into the twentieth. Then like the crack of doom we found the Kingdom ideal rejected by the philosophers of earth, and the earth bathed in blood, and muck, and war. With reverence again I say, Christ had no such delusions.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_748.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">THE LEAVENED MEAL</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_749.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_750.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: left;">Finally if this parable corrects our thinking about this age, and tells us of its true nature, it should have its effect on our individual lives, and on our Church life to-day.  We should see to it that there is nothing in our lives contrary to the genius and spirit of our Lord and Master, and of the Kingdom of God  no loftiness or pride, or seeking for mastery, all contrary to the genius of the Kingdom of God and of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.  These false things create a false greatness which He disowns.  So surely as that false greatness is there, the unclean birds come in, and lodge in the Church, and in our lives and the Kingdom is thwarted and hindered.  We are not to help in the development of a great tree out of a mustard seed, which is the least of all seeds.  We are called upon to have faith as that smallest of seeds, as Jesus elsewhere said.  If we have that, then by the power of that faith, which is life, we can help to remove the mountains, and to fling up a highway for the coming of the King into His own Kingdom.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">I I<span class="s26">.

Again we have no explanation of it given by the Lord Himself.  However, in this case, especially to those who first heard it, there was no need of explanation, listening as they did from the Hebrew standpoint, and with their knowledge of the Hebrew writings, and of the symbolism of Hebrew figures of speech.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">They understood; undoubtedly, what was intended.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Why then has this become a disputed parable as to its true teach- ing ?  While not insisting upon it, I think it has been through medieval misinterpretation of it, in which the interpreters attempted to square the parable with what they thought was the fact concerning the enter- prise in the world of the Kingdom of God.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_754.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">There are two interpretations.  The first is that the leaven alone is a type of the Kingdom. When our Lord said,   The Kingdom of heaven is like unto <span><img width="47" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_755.gif"/></span> some stop there in their thinking.  If that is done, then we are almost driven to the conclusion that the figure of leaven was used as the type of something good, and therefore that the idea of the parable is that the Kingdom will be completely victorious in this age.  That is the view which is almost universally accepted as the interpretation of the parable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_756.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The other interpretation is that not the leaven alone illustrates the Kingdom, but that the whole picture is required, that of leaven hidden by a woman in three measures of meal.  If that be the true interpreta- tion, then leaven is the type of evil  a principle which, in the working, harms the Kingdom rather than helps it in this age.  Those are the two views,</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span><img width="12" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_757.gif"/></span>    <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_758.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="29" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_759.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Although the first is popular, we should guard ourselves against accepting the popular interpretation as being correct.  I am deliberately convinced that the latter is the true interpretation  first, because the former one contradicts the whole symbolic use of leaven in the Bible. If in this case leaven stands for good, it is the only case in the Bible which any expositor claims that it does so.  Again, the former interpre- tation contradicts the teaching of all the other parables     considered, in every one of which Jesus, referring to the process of the age, always marked limitation. No parable shows all the facts. Our Lord was illustrating the working of the Kingdom principle in the age which is to be consummated by His own advent, as He Himself did show.</p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Seeing that all the other parables speak of mixture, if this of the leaven is taken as being good, the whole leavened, then there is no mixture at all.  This would then contradict the teaching of all the other parables.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_760.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Again, I reject the earlier view, because it is disproved by the history of the centuries   and finally because the method is not in harmony with the method of the other parables.  In every parable of Jesus the whole picture is needed to understand His teaching.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_761.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_762.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">If we read this parable,   The Kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven,” and stay there, we are violating a principle. Jesus did not stop there. He said,   The Kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.”  It is not so that the Kingdom of heaven is like leaven. It is not the leaven alone that is the illustration of the Kingdom of heaven.</p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">Having then cleared the ground a little, let us turn to an examina- tion of the parable, taking our usual method of looking at the picture suggested, and then deducing the teaching.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_763.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_764.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">As we look at the picture, we must carefully examine the symbolism. There is the essential fact of the picture, and the facts which affect the central fact. What is the central fact   Leaven   No, three measures of meal. What are the facts affecting it ? Two, a woman, and leaven.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_765.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 26pt;text-align: justify;">Three measures of meal.”  When Jesus said that, He was not using occasional language, but employing a phrase that had a definite meaning and value to those who heard it.  It is often very valuable to find where the phrase first occurs in the Bible, and then to trace it through.  To do that in the case of these words, we shall find it used in Genesis, before the time of Moses, before the law was given.  I t occurs in the eighteenth chapter of Genesis, in a wonderful picture. It was used of the home, which was a tent erected under the oaks at Mamre. Abraham lived there. He had left Ur of Chaldea, and had pitched his tent under the oak trees, or the terebinths as it should be rendered. He was living  there.  One day there came visitors to him, all of them evidently supernatural. He recognized One of them as</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 163pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE LEAVENED MEAL          <span class="s63">53</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_766.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_767.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_768.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_769.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">supreme, and the other two subservient.  I imagine Abraham did not know at the beginning Who this supreme Visitor was.  He recognized that He was a supernatural Visitor, and immediately they prepared and offered hospitality. In that connection we are told that Sarah prepared   three measures of meal.”  What was it ?  It was a meal of fellowship, of hospitality   a meal in which the supernatural Visitor, Whom Abraham soon found to be God Himself, having angelic form, and human language to communicate with him was to take part  and Abraham spread a meal for Him,   three measures of meal.”  So the phrase went back to that early time, indicating the preparation of a meal.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_770.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Come now to the time of Moses, and see the instructions for the meal offering, one of the offerings of a religious rite. Then later, Gideon, on a memorable occasion, brought to God three measures of meal. Hannah, when worshipping, brought as an offering, three measures of meal.  Pass on into the prophetic literature, and Ezekiel at one time, when describing the hour of ritual and worship, used the phrase seven times over to mark a certain fact,   three measures of meal.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_771.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_772.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_773.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: left;">Coming back for a moment to the ritual of these Hebrew people, the phrase became well known,   three tenths parts of an <span><img width="44" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_774.gif"/></span><span class="s29"> </span>which is the same thing as   three measures of meal,” in the meal offering.  In the ritual of the Hebrew people, the meal offering followed the burnt offering.  The burnt offering was symbolic of the dedication of the lives of these people to God.  The meal offering following, always symbolized the dedication of the service of the people, whose lives were dedicated to God.  The meal offering was first the result of cultivation, and then manufacture  of careful preparation, and so of their service. Always three measures of meal.  So that which we first see in the home yet had upon it that great eternal fact of man’s communion with God. As Abraham talked with Jehovah, as Jehovah was represented in the angel Presence, that which commenced there we see was embodied in the sacred ritual of the Hebrew people, as an offering marking dedication to God, also marking fellowship with God.</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Remembering the institution of the meal offering, every worshipper retained part, while part was devoted to God.  Consequently in that division of the three measures of meal there was indicated the hospi- tality of the soul to God, and the hospitality of God to the soul. There- fore this phrase that we may read so easily and never really understand, these men as they listened to Jesus, understood that figure in their literature as an interpretation of life.  When our Lord spoke of three measures of meal, inevitably their minds would go to the meal offering. The essential thing here is that the Kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.</p><p style="padding-left: 80pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Two things are here in the picture of Jesus, first, fellowship with</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span><img width="13" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_775.gif"/></span>    <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_776.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_777.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">God, hospitality between the soul and God  and offering and dedica- tion to God.  Go on to the apocalyptic literature, and in those wonderful letters written to the seven Churches, the Head of the Church is standing outside the door of the last of the Churches.  He had knocked, seeking admission, and He says,  If any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.”  I will come in, and be his Guest and at the same time he shall be My guest. That is perfect fellowship. In the symbolism of the Hebrew people all that lies behind the meal offering.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_778.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_779.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="22" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_780.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_781.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Jesus said,   The Kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.”  A woman, and leaven.  The woman represented authority and management in the hospitality of a home.  Sarah was doing that work on that first occasion, when Abraham held communion with Jehovah about His Kingship over Sodom  and Sarah had her part in that communion.  Without criticizing her, she broke down, for she laughed at certain things that were said.  Oh, it is better to laugh at God than never to    to Him  and He will be patient with us, if in our blindness we laugh.  I think I have often done it in utter foolish- ness. Here then a woman represented that communion and that authority. We speak of the Church as a mother. The great Roman system ever speaks of Mother Church. I am not objecting to it. Authority within the realm of hospitality and fellowship is provided in the figure of a woman.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_782.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 109pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">What did the woman do   She hid leaven in the three measures</p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">of meal.  Now leaven is always symbolic of that which disintegrates, breaks up, corrupts.  There was <span class="s64">no </span>leaven in Sarah’s bread when she prepared three measures of meal.  Leaven was strictly forbidden in the meal offering. It was to be excluded therefrom. To turn from those ancient suggestions and symbols to the New Testament, Paul, writing to a Corinthian Church that had become leavened indeed, in that bad sense of the word, and had lost its power of witness because it had been harbouring those corrupting, said this <span class="s64">:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_783.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_784.gif"/></span></p><p class="s64" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: left;">Know ye <span class="s48">not that a little Ieaven leaveneth the whole lump     Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="46" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_785.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_786.gif"/></span></p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For our        also hath been sacrificed, even Christ   wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_787.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_788.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">Or again, in the Galatian letter, he said the same thing in another connection.    A little leaveneth the whole lump.”  Leaven is always disintegrating.  To  interpret    parable of Jesus by the common practices of the day, yeast, however used, is a disintegrating force, and in the end it always separates and destroys.

The Bible is a wonderful literature. So many things that seem to be miles apart belong to each other.  What was it that stilled the complaint of the soul of the prophet Habakkuk, and made him sing his great song at last, after all his trouble   The announcement by God of a principle of life. Speaking of Cyrus the enemy, and the proud oncoming armies that God was using, under His control, He said,   Behold, his soul is puffed up,” that is, swollen <span><img width="13" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_793.png"/></span> it is not upright in him but the just shah live by his faith.”  Take that picture of evil, of pride and crookedness, acting like leaven, until men of a nation become puffed up, swollen.  Jesus said that would happen to the working of His Kingdom in this age, that there should be the hiding of leaven in the three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Turning from that attempt to understand the figures of speech, and to gather up its teaching, take the three measures of meal, repre- senting the feast of hospitality and fellowship between God and men. If the Kingdom testimony in the world is to be powerful, it must be based upon the fellowship of the people of God with Him in incorrupt- ness. That needs no argument. We all agree to it. The measure in which our fellowship with God fails to be maintained in incorruptness, freedom from disintegrating forces that destroy it, is the measure in which we fail to bear a Kingdom testimony, or are of value in the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_794.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="41" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_795.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Go back once more to Abraham and Lot.  Look at the difference between them. Lot was a good man. The New Testament tells us that he was  a righteous man.”  But he first pitched his tent towards Sodom. Then he went to live in      Finally he became so identified with Sodom that he lost all his influence.  When the crisis came there were not five men in the city whom he had influenced towards righteousness and God.  Abraham stood under the terebinths in fellowship with God, and he was able to exert that influence that nearly saved Sodom.  So come on down the ages, and see the influence working for the incoming of the Kingdom of God.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_796.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="68" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_797.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">We learn then that testimony to the Kingdom is weakened in the measure in which the Church in her management has ever permitted the intrusion of the things which disintegrate, and so mar her testimony to the Kingdom of God.

He was dealing with the fact that the Church was <span><img width="42" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_801.gif"/></span></p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 103pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_802.gif"/></span>    <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_803.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: left;">ing within her own borders an incestuous person, guilty of immorality. The Church was unable to deal with that person. Purge yourself from the leaven, said Paul.  Or in the word quoted from Galatians, the context shows that Judaizing teachers were attempting to graft on to the Christian movement a ritual that had no force and value and so were placing a burden upon believers that they never ought to bear, the leaven of legalism within the Church.  Take that little group of Scriptures, and read them, and think the matter out.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_804.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">What is the <span class="s25">leaven </span>intermixed, which has weakened the testimony of the Church to the Kingdom of God ?  The leaven of hypocrisy, the leaven of rationalism, that showed in the Sadducean questioning of the supernatural, for they did not believe in angel, spirit, or resurrection. The leaven of materialism was embodied in <span><img width="38" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_805.gif"/></span> who sought for power and greatness upon+the basis of material things <span><img width="12" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_806.png"/></span> the leaven of <span><img width="46" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_807.gif"/></span>  The leaven of the toleration of evil, the failure to exercise a high discipline to keep the Church clean and pure  and the terrible leaven of mere formalism, content with rite and ceremonial, devoid of power. Jesus said, The whole will be leavened. It does not mean that the whole will become leaven, but the influence of leaven hidden</p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">in the measures of meal, that illustrate fellowship, will permeate the whole movement.</p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Here then in the four first parables of Jesus, He saw the Kingdom influence in the age.  First, the seed, the fact of the giving of oppor- tunity.  Secondly, the good seed planted in the world’s field, similar in intention to the first.  Thirdly, the mustard seed that grew abnormally until it became a great tree.  Finally the meal into which is introduced the principle of disintegration, breaking in upon the fellowship of man with God.  Take these four and notice how in every case He marked the fact of comparative failure in the age, the failure of the seed, only one quarter of it fruitful, three parts of it scattered, and not fruitful at all.  Side by side with the work of the Son of man sowing in His field, the world, with His wheat, He saw an enemy sowing the imita- tion, the darnel.  False development into a great tree, magnificent in appearance, a lodging place for the fowls of the air.  Then the degenera- tion in power, breaking in upon fellowship, and so marring the witness of men and women to the Kingdom of God.</p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">To use a phrase employed in our previous study.  Whatever we may think of the process of affairs in this age, Christ was under no delusion.  He looked on, and saw exactly what has happened.  Every- thing has happened, and is happening according to His teaching.  There are other aspects which succeeding parables will unfold. Those to which we come next were spoken to the disciples alone.  To cover the whole ground of the two groups of four, the first four were spoken to men of sight, to the disciples and to the crowd; the second four were spoken to men of faith, and were spoken to the disciples only.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE TREASURE HIDDEN          <span class="s29">5 7</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="20" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_808.png"/></span></p><p class="s65" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The Treasure Hidden</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Matthew xiii, <span><img width="13" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_809.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_810.gif"/></span></p><p class="s37" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 28pt;text-align: left;">T</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">HE PARABLE <span class="p">contained in this verse is the first of those spoken to the disciples alone.  In verse thirty-six we read,   Then He left</span></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the multitudes, and went into the house.”  Then the disciples asked Him to explain the parable of the darnel.  He did so, and then uttered four more parables to them privately</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">These four also deal with the Kingdom in this age.  Our Lord was surveying an age which began with His own coming and ministry, and will conclude, as He taught in two of the parables, with the con- summation of the age.  These parables then have to do with this age in which we are living.  In the economy of God other ages stretch out beyond.</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">It should be borne in mind that the viewpoint is changed in the four parables now to be considered.  Having spoken to men of sight, Jesus now spoke to men of faith.  That necessarily creates a difference in outlook.  He had spoken to men of sight, and therefore had dwelt upon aspects of the Kingdom which would be patent to such and self-evident as the age unfolded.  He had foreshadowed that there would be the sowing of seed, with different results, dependent upon the quality of the seed.  In the next He had shown how during this age, side by side with the sowing of the good seed, there would be the work of an enemy sowing darnel, imitations of the good seed.  He had shown then how during this period there would be unnatural develop- ment of a mustard seed to a great tree.  Finally He had shown how during the age there would be a process of degeneration in the Kingdom under the figure of the leavened meal.  Look back over the age from the word of our Lord while here until this time, and it will be seen how all the things that He foretold have been manifest.  The seed has been sown with differing results.  The enemy has been sowing the damel, perplexing even the elect.  The Church has been cursed by organiza- tions that have been harboured in her very life, and there has been a breaking down of her testimony, making her fellowship ineffective, and her testimony to men equally ineffective.</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Now the Lord spoke to His disciples, to those men of faith who already believed in Him, who would go out to live on the principle of faith, even though everything appeared to be against them,  He now gave them four parables, and these have to do with the age, revealing the Divine thought and method, and purpose in it. These are not patent to sight. They constitute the secrets of God, but they are revealed to men of faith, knowing which, and understanding which, they will be strengthened and heartened and equipped for all their</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span><img width="12" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_811.gif"/></span>    <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">service.  That is the character of the four parables to which we now come, the first of which we survey in this chapter.</p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">To summarize briefly on the four.  In the first He showed the pur- pose of God for the whole <span><img width="44" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_812.png"/></span> He buyeth the field.”  In the second, in many ways the most wonderful of them all, He showed the relation to other ages and other spheres of what is now being done, as the pearl is being purchased.  The third declared the method of the age in the economy of God, a great drag-net flung out into the sea, enclosing all manner of fish.  The last showed the responsibility of those who are His scribes in the new Kingdom.</p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Turn now to the first. We follow our custom of attempting to see the picture, and then deduce the teaching.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_813.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_814.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: right;">There are parts of this picture with which we are familiar. Our Lord had already used two figures in the earlier parables, which He explained. So there is no <span><img width="51" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_815.gif"/></span> about them. First,   the field,” The Kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hidden in the field.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_816.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">We have seen that  the field is the world.”</p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Then, again, a man buys the field.  We have seen that the man is the Son of man, so named in the earlier parables. Here then is a picture of the world, and the relation of Christ to it. Those two facts of the general picture are quite clear, because of previous explanation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_817.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Then two new ideas are introduced here  treasure, and purchase at cost.  The man is seen discovering treasure in the field, as selling all that he had in order to buy that field, and secure that treasure.  The treasure is there, but it is hidden.  Someone finds it, knows it is there, and realizes it. Others do not know it is there. Then in order to possess that treasure this man sells everything that he has to buy that field.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_818.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">That brief statement of what the picture presents will enable us to begin our study, as it-relieves us from speculation on two points, the field, and the Man   and leaves us free to discuss the two new figures in relation to the other two.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_819.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_820.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_821.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_822.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="7" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_823.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">What is the relation of this treasure to the whole world    The field is the world.”  He sees that treasure in that field, He has discovered it.  What was the treasure that He saw, as He looked out upon the world   Unquestionably it was the Kingdom of God hidden in the world, the Divine government, in its principles, its order, and its exceeding beauty.  It is a remarkable thing that we are told that this was hidden in the field.  He saw the world as made for the display of the glory of God. He saw the vicegerent of the world in rebellion against God, and therefore unable to realize the possibilities of the cosmos.  He saw the whole territory waste and void, as the result of misgovernment  but the potentialities were there, and He saw in the world what has well been described as   imprisoned  splendour.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_824.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_825.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 109pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">I am using the word  world  in the fullest sense, as when our Lord</p><p class="s44" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 158pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE TREASURE HIDDEN           <span><img width="13" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_826.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_827.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_828.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_829.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_830.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_831.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_832.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_833.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 2pt;text-align: left;">used it, according to Mark and said we were to go out into all the cosmos, the whole order of the material, mental, and spiritual  the cosmic order which had been broken in upon and destroyed.  But our Lord saw the possibilities of this world  and His work in life was that of exhibiting those hidden splendours and glories in strange and unexpected ways, and declaring all the time the glory of the Kingdom of God. How the glory of the world is constantly revealed to us. Flowers   Yes, He said God clothed them. Birds  Yes, God takes care of them, and feeds them, and is with them when they die.  Chil- dren   Their angels do always behold the face of the Father.

He looked and saw the treasure hidden in a ruined world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_835.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_836.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: left;">What did He do ?  He purchased it, and when He purchased it, He hid it.  That is the point of mystery, the point at which we must halt. We wonder what it means. It was hidden. He brought it into visibility, and hid it.  In the world order we have a revelation of the ultimate, the Kingdom ministry of Jesus while here in the world not the ultimate limit of it, but the ultimate of it during His own mission.  He came to discover and to reveal it.  The eyes that could see this splendour that was imprisoned, He made it flash and flame forth. There were those who saw, and gathered round about it.  But it was rejected, and He rejected the nation that had been the depository of the Kingdom of God in the solemn words recorded by Matthew,  The Kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.”  He postponed the full mani- festation to a future age when the Son of man should come in His glory, and the holy angels with Him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_837.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_838.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_839.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">He then turned His face to a larger work, apart from which the splendours hidden could never come to full and final realization.  All that is expressed in that simple sentence,   He sold all that He hath, and buyeth that field.” Everything is there.  It is a complete revela- tion of the ultimate in the work of Jesus in the world, and for the world. Notice how it begins.   In His joy, He goeth and selleth all that He hath.”  We interpret that as imprisoned splendour, hidden glories that are not manifest.  He revealed them in measure, and yet they were not seen by the vast masses.

That word  buyeth  may be used in other senses, where there is no commercial transaction.  There has been a good deal of expository controversy over this.  There are not wanting old and devout expositors who say that He bought the world back from Satan. Never  He never recognized the right of Satan to this world at all.  That is what Satan wanted Him to do, and he offered it to Him at a very cheap price comparatively, when he said, Give me a moment’s homage, and the kingdoms shall all be Thine.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_866.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 162pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">THE TREASURE HIDDEN</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But He never recognized the right of Satan anywhere.  He was not buying it from Satan.</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Then equally devout expositors say He was purchasing it from God. But that is to divide God, and God is not divided. He was God, He was God in Christ reconciling the world to Himself.  It was God in Christ Who purchased.  Often the word is used in another way.  A man says he will sell his life dearly.  It does not mean he is going to offer it at a price. He is going to suffer in order to hold it. A mother will purchase the health of her child by long vigils.  She is not paying the price to anyone.  He purchased the field, which simply emphasizes the giving up of all things in the richest sense of that word.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_867.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Stand back then from this picture, given to the disciples.  It was not given to the men of the world.  The outside crowd did not understand it any more than some to-day can understand.  It can be understood only by men of living faith, faith in the unseen, believing in the reality of the unseen, and seeing things from that viewpoint. The man of faith in this age will be conscious of all that the man of sight sees, of everything that is named in those first four parables.  Men of faith see all the facts of the case as Jesus saw them, with such clarity as those saw when He uttered these parables. Jesus was not deceived. He suffered from no delusion. He knew the delusion that so often has fallen upon the Christian Church, and holds many of those dear and loved members in thrall to-day in the view that we are to go on preaching the Gospel until all the world is converted.  That will not be. He saw the facts, and nineteen hundred years bear witness to the accuracy of His outlook.

The glory of every- thing in the government of God, in the Kingdom of heaven, the King- dom of the rule of God, He saw it, the possibility.  If we do not see that possibility, what wonder that we lose heart, that our hands hang down, and our knees become feeble, and we cease our efforts. He saw that possibility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_870.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_871.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">But He saw more, that there was only one way of possessing that treasure, of bringing at last into full and final manifestation and glory and that was the way of complete self-denial.

It is arresting to remem- ber that the pearl was not counted precious by the Hebrews.  They set no particular value upon it.  The pearl is never mentioned in the Old Testament. Other stones are named and described by that marvellous phrase   stones of fire,” but the pearl is not referred to. In the book of Job there is an interesting and wonderful passage in which he asked what was the price of wisdom, and named certain things by which wisdom cannot be bought.  He named precious stones, and in the margin of the Revised Version we <span><img width="25" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_893.gif"/></span> when Job referred to crystal,” the revisers have inserted in the margin,   or pearl.”  Even marginal readings are not inspired.  The Hebrew word there is figura- tive, and means something frozen, and the word   crystal  far better interprets it than   pearl.”  Thus the pearl had no significance to the</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Hebrews, and there was no reference to it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_894.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_895.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_896.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">When these Hebrew disciples listened to Jesus when He uttered this parable, I think they opened their eyes in surprise.  A pearl   A merchantman seeking pearls   Nobody was particularly seeking pearls. Moreover, He made reference to the pearl as of  great price.”  Let it be admitted that among other peoples than the Hebrews there was a recognition of the value of pearls, and it is an interesting subject to trace.  There was a growing sense of their value.  Recent investigations have shown that in the regalia of kings which consisted largely of gold, inset with gems, actually pearls were found.  In Nineveh pearls were very highly valued, more so than in other countries.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">To-day the pearl has become associated with the most precious things, and is of real value.  In this parable then of the pearl, as the King revealed secret things to men of faith, whatever His intention was, He turned to something which these people did not consider of value, and He laid tremendous emphasis upon its value.</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 103pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_897.gif"/></span>    <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_898.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="34" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_899.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: right;">What  are the facts about real pearls   They are the products of a living organism.  That is not true of any other precious stone, either of the sapphire, or the diamond, the ruby, the emerald, or any other. How is it produced ?  The pearl is the result of an injury done to a living  organism.  A grain of sand gets within the shell of the oyster, and injury is done to it.  That which it injures covers it over with the layer over layer, until the pearl is formed.

There is no real value in the pearl except embellishment, the adding of something to the one who possesses it, or the one who wears it.  The very word translated  pearl  is derived from a Sanskrit word which means pure.  Every woman who bears the name of Margaret or Margarita, that is the meaning of the name.  The pearl stands to-day in our thinking suggestive of purity.  If that be so, the pearl is a symbol of purity resulting from wounding, which has been enclosed in that which has made it a thing of beauty, and a symbol of purity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_905.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_906.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Our Lord never used an illustration without complete under- standing of all its height and length and breadth and depth  and when He said  a pearl,” He knew whence the pearl came, and how the pearl was formed.  He knew its real value.  That is the first emphasis which arrests us.  There is something different here from anything we have seen, nothing that contradicts, but something different.</p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Then again, in the merchantman we see a man seeking goodly pearls.  It is unthinkable that the man seeking pearls is seeking them merely for himself.  Pearls in so far as their value was known then, were specifically and particularly for the adornment of kings.  The man who was seeking them was seeking in order to provide that embellish- ment, that symbol of glory, for other than himself.  The merchantman was seeking for pearls, not to hoard them, or to possess them, but for some other.  Whether this man was purchasing and selling them does not come within our purview.  Jesus said he sought for goodly pearls, and he found one of priceless worth,  It was a most wonderful victory. A pearl of resplendent beauty is referred to, and in order to possess it, he went and sold everything he had.</p><p style="padding-left: 112pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Turning from that attempt to look at the picture in itself, we ask</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 189pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE PEARL              <span><img width="12" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_907.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">its  interpretation.  Here it is possible that some may be introduced to a line of thought and consideration which is new.  We need not argue who the man is.  He is the One Who has been named in other places as the Son of man but here He is seen as a merchantman.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_908.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_909.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_910.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_911.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">What is He doing   He is seeking pearls, and He finds one,  Find- ing means here, He perceives, He <span><img width="56" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_912.gif"/></span> and He obtains.

We are looking from the heavenly height, and we see this merchantman seeking, and seeing what He finds, and seeing how to obtain what He finds.  Notice our Lord says,   Having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had.”  Went where   Went from the place where He was. Where was that  Heaven. That does not mean He left earth, and went away to purchase it, but He came to earth. The parable is viewing things from the heavenly standard.  He has seen the pearl.  He knows it, and desires to possess it, and He went to earth, and sold all that He had.  It is a picture of the purchase of the Church of God, the whole Church.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_914.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_915.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">All kinds of questions arise, distinguishing between the Church and the Kingdom of God.  There is a clear distinction, and in the ages that lie ahead there will be many who are ransomed who are not members of the great, mystical Church of Christ.  But the view here is that of the Church. He went and found a pearl. With great reverence we may say He went, and by His action created the pearl. The pearl fastened upon Him, injured Him, harmed Him  and by His action He surrendered all that which wrought Him wrong, and harmed Him, until it, by transmutation, became the very costly pearl for which He was seeking.   He sold all that he had.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="33" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_916.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_917.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_918.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_919.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="18" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_920.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="2" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_921.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="2" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_922.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="2" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_923.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_924.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_925.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: right;">With reverence take the picture of the pearl, and the process of its making, that action of a living organism that surrounds the tormented and unperceived thing with mother-of-pearl, with      until presently the pearl is formed. When Peter wrote his letter he said,   Unto Whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect,  precious.”  After that he said this,   For you therefore which believe is the preciousness.”  In the Authorised Version it reads, Unto you that believe He is precious.”  That is a beautiful statement and thought, one of absolute truth. Is He not precious to us  But that is not what the apostle meant.  It is not what he wrote.   Unto you     is the preciousness.”  The Stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the Head of the corner and all that constitutes the good pleasure of God in Christ,   My Son, in Whom I am well pleased.”  The things in Christ that were precious to God, they are all made over to us.   Unto you that believe is the preciousness.” But who am <span><img width="8" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_926.gif"/></span> who are you ?

The picture is of what is going on in this age, the finding and the purchasing of this sacred thing. We are warranted, however, in deducing from it something more.  What was the purpose of this purchase ?  Roughly and commercially, what was the value of that pearl, to obtain which He sold all that He had in order to buy it   We cannot answer that fully in the terms of time, or in the terms of individual and personal experience.  We cannot answer that fully in the terms of any one Church, or the Church at any given period in this age.  We can answer it fully only when there is given to us to see the ultimate glory of the Church, and her ultimate vocation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_930.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">We have never seen the Church of God.  Churches, yes we have a conception of the universal Church, the holy, catholic Church as we call it  but we have never yet seen it.  It is a sorry thing that Christian men, leaders quarrel among themselves.  The day will come when we shall see that our quarrels have been concerned with scaffolding, but behind the scaffolding the Church is growing to a holy temple in the Lord.  If we would find the final interpretation in the New Testament of the value of the pearl He bought, of the value of the Church to God, we shall have to turn to one great letter, that to the Ephesians. In that Paul reached the culminating glory of his great theological system.  That system began with the Roman letter, of which the one theme is salvation.  Then there came to him the mystery of the Church, and by stages he interpreted it.  The ultimate glory is found in the twin epistles of Ephesians and Colossians. Colossians is concerned with the glories of Christ.  Ephesians is concerned with the glories of the Church as she embodies and reveals the glories of Christ.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_931.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_932.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Glance at two passages in the Ephesian letter.

It lifts all our thinking about our holy religion from the commonplace of to-day and the littleness of our activities here, however true they may be, when we see that God gains something in His Church  that when Jesus sold all that He had to buy that pearl to flash in splendour upon the bosom of Deity, God was enriched.

Christ also loved the Church, and gave Himself up for it, that He might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the Word, that He might present the Church to Himself, a glorious Church, not having <span class="s39">spot or </span>wrinkle or any such thing  but that it should be holy and without  blemish.”  The intrusive wounding sand is transmuted into the beauty of a pearl, and that for the honour of God.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="25" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_937.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_938.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">In the Ephesian letter there are two statements in which Paul tells what is the ultimate vocation of the Church.  It is not earthly at all. She has her vocation here, and her responsibility in the world, which in our measure we are all attempting to fulfil.  But the ultimate mean- ing of the Church is not for time, it is for eternity.  It is not for earth, but for heaven, the place where all the company of the ransomed and redeemed will     a sacred mission.  Paul has told us two things about that mission.  In the ages to come we shall teach angels  and through us there will be manifested the grace and the glory of God.

The consummation of the age   is the key to what our Lord emphasized concerning this</p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">parable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_952.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">This is in itself significant, and enables us to place the emphasis of the parable in the right place. The net and its swaying to the moving tides are simply illustrations of the fact not here and now interpreted.  But that which is interpreted, and therefore that upon which we must fix our attention, is our Lord’s description of what will happen presently, in what He speaks of as   the consummation of the age.”  It is the parable therefore of all these which supremely shows the method of the completion of this age, in which the Sower sows the Word.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_953.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_954.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_955.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: right;">The main value here is that of the fact of separation which follows the drawing in of the net at the end of the age.  Recognition of that fact will save us from wrong conceptions concerning this teaching. The Kingdom of heaven is like unto a drag-net.”  In the Revised Version the word is  a net,” but the marginal reading gives the literal translation of the Greek word, which explains its meaning,   a drag-</p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">net.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="20" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_956.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_957.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_958.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_959.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Again, those fishermen listening to Him understood perfectly what He was talking about.  That was one method of fishing.  It had nothing to do with individual fishing.  Here is no picture, such as Ezekiel gave, of fishermen standing on the banks of the river from Engedi to eglaim.  That is individual gathering in.  This was not the idea in the mind of our blessed Lord when He said to His disciples,  I will make you to become fishers of men   and on another occasion, You shall catch men alive.  That marks individual life.  This is something other.</p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The fact is so simple that we need not dwell upon it.  It is the picture of a great net that is let down into the sea, and is left, and it swings to the moving of the waters, and there are gathered into it fishes of all sorts, all kinds.  Then towards the close of day, or early morning more often, the fishermen draw the net in, and as it comes in it enclosed a vast multitude of fishes.  Some of them are of no use. Others are valuable.  The fishermen are seen settled down on the shore,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 180pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE DRAG-NET             <span><img width="12" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_960.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_961.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and their first business is to sort and sift, to take out    valueless, the worthless, and leave in the good, gathering them together, after the worthless have been cast aside.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_962.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Said our Lord, The Kingdom of heaven is like that in its con- summation.  The Kingdom of heaven is like a net let down into the sea  and at the end of the <span><img width="45" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_963.gif"/></span> consummation of the age, there will come the drawing in of the net, and separation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_964.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">The net here unquestionably stands for the Kingdom influence which is abroad in the world  and those enclosed are such as have come within the sphere of the Kingdom influence.  There are parts of the world where there are multitudes who have never come within that sphere. The parable does not apply to such. Wherever the net has been spread, and wherever men and women have come under its influence, there the net is seen in the sea, that sea which is for ever- more the type in Holy Scripture of restless, moving humanity.  Some- thing is let down into it.  It is the message of the Kingdom, the fact of the Kingdom, the vision of the Kingdom, the ideals of the Kingdom, the teaching of the Kingdom.  Remember, the Church is only in view here, in so far as its responsibility is concerned.  It is not a question of finding a pearl, whose sacred function lies not in time, but in eternity. That was our previous subject.  The Church in the world reveals the Kingdom, in herself, and is the instrument in the world of the influence of that Kingdom.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_965.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Think of the age in the broadest way, and of the fact that the Church has been in existence for <span><img width="25" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_966.gif"/></span> years and more.  Wherever she has been, men have seen something of the glory, beauty, and holiness, and strength and majesty, and mercy and tenderness of the Kinship of God.  Do not forget that has been so. Wherever that has been so the Kingdom influence has been felt.  All sorts of reforms in human life, in affairs political, and affairs economic, are the result of the exercise of this Kingdom influence   and the Kingdom influence has been exerted by the Church of God.  So the Church is here, but it is not the picture of the gathering out of the Church. It is the picture of something else. The race is not all here, only those parts of it where this Kingdom influence has reached, and only those <span class="s32">are </span>seen who by its influence have been in <span class="s32">some </span>measure, enclosed within the net.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_967.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_968.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_969.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="26" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_970.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_971.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">The process is then described, the process at the end, for that is the emphasis  what will happen as the result of the net being flung into the sea, left, enclosing all the while men, women-fishes.

The picture is wholly of this world.  Heaven is not in view.  The ultimate and eternal state is not referred to.  It is an earthly situation at which we are particularly looking.

The severance of the wicked that they may be destroyed from all human affairs.  The words of our Lord are full of terrible solemnity.  We have no more right to forget or neglect this word of Jesus than we have to forget or neglect that He said to humanity,   Come unto Me, and I will give you rest.”  There was the infinite wooing tenderness of Christ, but He never failed to see the ultimate issue of sin and of evil.  His words are characterized by terrible solemnity.  There shall be weeping, lamentation, and gnashing of teeth, a figure at once of pain or rage, or both.

We are living in a strange age.  It is terrible how even godly people have become Sadducean about angels, and try to escape the clear declaration that at the end of the age angels will once more intervene in human affairs.  They have inter- fered in human history and affairs in the past.  This is not the age of the angels.  It is the age of the Son.  It is the age of the Holy Spirit. But Jesus said when this age is drawing to a close, angels will again actually, positively intervene in human affairs.  Angels are serving to-day, but unseen and unknown very largely, but none the less definitely. We have our Bibles, and believe it.

When the prophet saw that he cried,  Woe is me  for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips  for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.  Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar  and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.” Liturgical spirits, their high function, the worship of God  but if, peradventure, some soul cries out in the agony of conscious sin, they become ministers of God.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1002.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="45" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1003.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1004.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">We used to sing in old days,   There are angels hovering round.” We do not often sing it now, but it is true.  They are not seen.  They do not come on to the plane of observation, but Christ distinctly said in that word at       Philippi, and on these two occasions in these parables, that at the end of the age the angels will actually come into human affairs, to carry out His will, and His behests.  They have been visible.  They will be again.  There are strange and wonderful pictures of angels, some of them full of suggestive beauty <span class="s60">in </span>art.  One great picture, the title of which was,   He was despised and rejected,” was exhibited in London some years ago.  It was wonderful, though the figure of the Christ did not satisfy me.  The crowd surging round Him was typical humanity, but the most wonderful thing to me was the background, the august and awful figure of an angel watching.  Jesus said when this age comes to its consummation, the Son of man will send forth His angels.  They will deal with this enclosed mass of fish, and will sort and sift it.  Angel  discrimination  means  heaven’s standards.  Angel separation means heaven’s might at work, insisting upon the standards, and bringing everything to its measurement, at the end of the age.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">We often lose sight of this.  Even the Church of God is so possessed oftentimes with the activities of the present.  Action in the present loses half its significance, power, and value if we lose sight of the fact of the end of the age, and the issue of it.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">What is the issue ?  This our parable does not declare.  For purposes of understanding we may refer to the King’s previous and fuller state- ment, in verses forty-one to forty-three, where we have exactly the same figure of the consummation of the age, and the angels are seen.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">In this parable our Lord spoke of what would be done with the things found in that gathered-in net.

To put those two together, at the end of this age what will happen under angel intervention and ministry   First the cleansing of the Kingdom from all things that cause stumbling, and all that do iniquity-activities and persons. Think what would happen to-day, if suddenly all the affairs of the world were halted by the visitation of angel ministers, acting by the order of the King, and they began to deal with every- thing that caused stumbling to humanity, casting out all those who were workers of iniquity, the bringing of limitation and sorrow to such, not the limitation of sorrow that has in it the element of repentance, but the element of remorse, as witness the gnashing of teeth.  Evil persistence to the very end is to be dealt with, gathered up, and cast out by angel ministry.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1007.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">What our Lord did not say in this parable, but did say in the previous one was,   Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father.”  That is far more than a poetical figure, describing the blessedness that shall come to the righteous. It is much more than that.  It is rather a figure of the influence that the righteous shall exert when all these evil things are removed, and they shine forth in the Kingdom of the Father. They will create the opportunity for goodness, and the opportunity of nations that have never been reached.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1008.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Does that not bring halt and shock to some ?  Surely all this is going on, until all nations have been reached, and all nations have bowed to Christ.  Is that our view  It was not His. Never in one of these parables did He teach anything of the kind.  He never suggested the work of the Church was to go on and on until all nations had bowed to Him, and kissed His sceptre, and crowned Him.  He knew human nature better than that, and He knew all the things that so often have puzzled the Church, and made them at times feel as though every- thing was failing. He knew. But when that consummation of this age comes, as the prelude to other ages that lie beyond in earth’s history, the angels will gather out all these offending things, and the righteous will shine forth as the sun, and that will create the oppor- tunity for other nations.</p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The parable is of the nature of a look ahead. There are some senses in which to-day we have little to do with it, for the net is still swinging, and the Kingdom influence is still being exerted, and the reaches of the net are going further and further out, as every great society we call Missionary takes the Kingdom to the peoples of the earth. We have nothing to do with the pulling in of that net.

Events proved they had not grasped the real signifi- cance of all He had said.   But they had gone so far   and however much we may say about their limited understanding, our Lord took them at their own valuation.   Immediately He proceeded to utter this parable.

He compelled the disciples to face it, and they were honest as far as they went in their reply.

Here our Lord did an arresting thing, though it is possible we may not at first be arrested by it, or notice it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1038.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1039.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">It is that of His use of the word   scribe  at that point.  From the commencement of His ministry, and growingly, there was an order of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1040.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="45" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1041.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1042.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">men called scribes, and they were opposed to Him,    the scribes and Pharisees.”   Who were these men ? When our Lord foretold His suffering at        Philippi, He said He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things at the hands of chief priests, elders, and scribes. That was no mere piece of rhetoric.   He was describing the three orders actually then existing in Jerusalem, and among the Hebrew people</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1043.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1044.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">the priests, the spiritual rulers   elders, the civil rulers  and scribes, the moral rulers.  The moral rulers had been opposed to our Lord through- out His ministry.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="22" height="6" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1045.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">As a class the scribes arose in the time of Ezra.   There was no order of scribes in Moses’ time.  The scribes in Old Testament history were the historians, and principally military historians.   But in the time of Ezra there arose a    order of scribes, and Ezra was the outstanding</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 171pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE  HOUSEHOLDER           <span class="s33">75</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1046.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">figure of that order.  He made a pulpit of wood, and stood on it, from which he read the law, giving the sense.  That does not merely mean he read correctly, and with clear articulation, though that undoubtedly is inferred.  It simply means that he read the law and explained it. There was a great Bible movement, a Scriptural movement at that time under Ezra.  So this order of scribes arose.  They were men who read the law, and explained it  consequently they became the moral interpreters.</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">As time wore on these men became more and more concerned with the letter of the law, and they attempted to safeguard it by building a fence around it.  That fence consisted of the traditions that were supposed to interpret the law.  In process of time it not only shut out the law, but shut men out from it, and men came to misunderstand the law through the traditions and teaching and interpreters, those men whose whole business was to interpret it. So in the time of Jesus He flung Himself in anger oftentimes against these traditions and these false teachers, the scribes, the official interpreters of the law.</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Again another reference. Upon one occasion in remarkable language our Lord quoted from them, calling them the interpreters of the law. He said they sat in Moses’ seat.  Their business was to interpret the law of Moses, and Jesus set the seal of His authority upon the idea, never upon the men, but upon the idea.  Going on, He said Therefore, because they sit in Moses’ seat, whatsoever they say unto you do it, only do not ye as they do.  Thus He set His seal upon the authority of that order.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1047.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="55" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1048.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Christ had now been instructing His men, His disciples, those representative men who were to interpret the Kingdom of heaven to the world, and He named them by that same name  and in so doing, He transferred the        of an office from men who had failed to men who were to succeed them.  In order to achieve the fulfilment of responsibility, therefore there must be understanding of the King’s teaching concerning the Kingdom in this age.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1049.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Once again go back to these parables.  According to Jesus, this age is to be one of conflict from beginning to end, characterized largely by human break-down and failure.  But it is to be an age in which God accomplishes definite purpose both in the world and in human history, and in the creation of an instrument for the ages to come. Said Jesus, Have you understood these things, have you grasped My teaching   If you have a sense of what this age is to be like, you are to go out into it as scribes.</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Come now to the parable.  Every such scribe, made a disciple him- self to the Kingdom of heaven by the teaching of Christ, standing for it, every such one is like a householder.</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">What is a householder ?

To illustrate and illuminate, Jesus one day said to these men,   Fear not, little flock, it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.”   To the Western mind particularly it may look as though our Lord were mixing His metaphors.   A merely literary critic might say, This Teacher is confused.   He begins His statement with a shepherd and a flock.   He forgets it before He has gone far, and it is the man and his family.   Then He forgets that, and the picture is of a nation and a king and Kingdom.   But we know perfectly well that if the figures merge they do not mix.   They reveal the threefold aspect of a head of a clan, or a nation and people.   The Arab shiek to-day at once is the shepherd of his people, the father of the family, and king of the nation   and all these are involved in   the house- holder.”  The disciple to the Kingdom of heaven is like a householder. That word   householder   was on the lips of Jesus some ten or twelve times, and almost invariably He used it of Himself.    It is the word that marks authority.   The disciples were to be scribes, authoritative interpreters of the moral law.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1057.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">What then does the householder do     He brings forth from his treasure house. He brings forth treasure. There are two words for</p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">treasure in the New Testament.   One means that which is laid up,</p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">layer on layer, and kept.   The other means that which is spent.

We find them both in the Sermon on the Mount.   Here it is the word which means laid up. The householder is seen as having vast resources.

They have access to the eternal treasure-house, and in that treasure-house there are things new and old. Mark the arresting picture of these disciples of Jesus in the age.  We see the age, on the human side, as it will be seen by men of sight.  But we see also the Divine side, as it is seen in the purpose of God, having a far wider application than earth or time stretching out into the ages.  That is the Kingdom of God, and therefore there is the treasure-house, and these disciples, made disciples to that Kingdom, by understanding that teaching, and that outlook, are to go forth to exercise the true authority. The scribe was the moral authority.

The Church has been doing that very thing.  She has been exercising moral author- ity in the history of the world from Jesus until to-day.  I know how she seems to have failed.  Our Lord told us there would be failure. We must, however, think bigly and broadly enough of history. Every great moral sentiment that obtains in the thinking of the world to-day has come to it through the Church of God.  Yes, failure again and again, but that thing still remains true.  The emancipation of womanhood, the emancipation of slaves, the value of children, the bed-rock basis of marriage,    these things have come because of the scribes of the Kingdom, who have been interpreters of its moral law. Theirs is the final authority, not that of kings, and rulers, and emperors, and presidents,  and  parliaments   but of those scribes who understand the Kingdom, and are made disciples thereto.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1065.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1066.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1067.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1068.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1069.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">What are they to do ?  They are to   bring forth things new and old.”  Jesus did not say to them they should bring forth new things, and old things. That is not two orders of things. It is two facts concerning the same things. They are one in essence. The principle is old, the application is new. The root is old. The blossom and the fruit are new. The old things are the eternal things, the eternal verities.  The new things are the applications of those eternal things to the passing phases of changing times.   Things new and old.” The two are necessary to growth.  If we destroy the old, there will be no new.  If we find an absence of new, we shall discover that the life of the old has ceased. Take an illustration from Nature.  Go into the garden. If that root be dead, there is no blossom, and no fruit. If the old be dead, the new does not appear.  Or look at it from the other side.  Come into the garden, and if there is no blossom, no fruitage, we know that the root is dead.   Things new and old.” The inter- relationship therefore is a perpetual test.

So He was approaching the end of the central period of public propaganda, so full of interest.  Hostility to Him on the part of the rulers, spiritual, moral, and civil, which had manifested itself from the beginning, had grown with the passing of the years.  Here they sent down to Him a deputation from Jerusalem with the explicit purpose undoubtedly, of somehow entangling Him, or asking for some explanation of things they did not understand, and to which they had most strongly objected in His teaching, and finally as that teaching had manifested itself in the conduct of His disciples.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="27" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1078.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: right;">The whole Hebrew religion at that time was suffering under the intolerable burden of tradition.

Here that is what manifested itself. We can hardly realize what that meant then.  The whole system of religion had passed under its yoke and incubus, and was in slavery to it.  In a previous chapter we have dealt fully with this subject.  To give two actual quotations from the rabbis of the time.   The words of the elders are weightier than the words of the prophets.”  Or another,  Some of the words of the law and the prophets are weighty, others are not weighty.

Take this case in point. These men had come down from Jerusalem to Jesus, and they had asked Him, Why do Thy disciples transgress the traditions of the elders when they eat bread ? They owned they were thinking  about  the tradition of the elders.  They had seen the disciples of Jesus transgress that tradition, ignore it, fail to observe it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1082.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The <span><img width="47" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1083.gif"/></span> were eating bread with unwashed hands.  There was no tradition that a man should wash his hands before food in order to  cleanliness.  It was not cleanliness that was in view, but ritual. All these traditions had become impregnated by superstition, and the rabbis were declaring that Shibta, a demon, sat upon the hands of men as they slept, and ceremonial washing was necessary, or food would be contaminated by the presence of that demon upon their hands, while they were asleep   We are inclined to smile at it.

It was a parable characterized by the greatest simplicity, that could not be misunderstood.  He led them to face the fact of the physical organism. He showed them that physical organism deals with physical aliment, that it has no reference to moral cleanness or defilement.  Notice carefully,   Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man.”  Then at once linking the thought with that other word, words proceeding out of the mouth, coming up out of the thoughts, they defile the man, because when thoughts are evil, words are evil, and acts are evil.  So by the false thinking and heart, the very flesh may be defiled. The sustenance of the flesh can have in it no defiling  element.  It is not that which enters into a man that defiles him, but that which comes out of the deeper fact of his nature, out of his heart, out of the realm of mind and spirit, mastering the activities of the flesh, thoughts producing acts, reacting in defilement.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="17" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1097.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">The teaching here is important.  The flesh in itself is not evil.  I t does not defile. Paul, and other New Testament writers constantly refer to the flesh as being that against which we have to watch and battle, which is true in certain ways.  <span class="s57">But the flesh inherently is not </span>evil. That is an    Gnostic heresy which cursed the early Church, and against which the writings of Paul were directed.  There is nothing inherently evil in flesh, and therefore that which sustains flesh could not defile. If we take food, it strengthens us in physical powers, because the flesh in itself is not inherently evil, and therefore it is not defiled.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="28" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1098.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1099.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 105pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">But a man pondering in his heart evil thoughts, may be led by so doing to the expression of words which presently will find further expression in deeds, and those very deeds will defile the     The flesh which is not inherently evil may become contaminated, harmed, and may become the very instrument of destruction and death.  But that is not the result of the food eaten. Consequently to believe contamination  resulted  was  stupid,  to  use  no  stronger  word.  The observance of external rules has no power to touch the inward spring of action.  We may observe all the rules, we may sign all the pledges, and we may not eat that food, nor drink that drink, nor go to that place  but the inner, spiritual life is not touched by these things.</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Paul warned some to whom he wrote against worship of the will,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1100.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 138pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">PARABOLIC ILLUSTRATIONS</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1101.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">when he wrote of being subject to ordinances,   Handle not, nor taste, nor touch.”  It is a curious thing that these words are often quoted as giving good advice.

It also stands for evermore as a warning against adding anything as a final authority in life to the law of God itself.  That is the consummate wrong that is being done by the Roman theologians.  Our Roman friends tell us we can read the Bible, but we must not interpret it.  We must accept the interpreta- tion of those in authority, the Church, as they say.  That is what these men of old said.  We have the law of God, but it cannot be interpreted save through tradition   and whenever tradition, whether of a priest, or a prophet, or a Bible teacher, is put in the place of authority over life, we are violating our own spiritual need, and wronging the Word of God. Only as priest, prophet, or teacher can lead men into living presence of the Word is there any value in his work.  Every- thing    is     tradition, which ultimately           of the truth of God.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1112.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1113.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">A brief reference to the parabolic illustration.

He crossed the border line between strictly Jewish and Gentile territory. Tyre and Sidon were outside Jewish territory. So was Decapolis. Our Lord first went up to Tyre and Sidon, and then went down to Decapolis.  In Tyre and Sidon this woman met Him, outside Jewish territory,  outside  the  ritual  of  the  Jewish  covenant.  Here,  and  in Decapolis He was among those not of the Jewish faith, but among the Gentiles. He had turned from Israel which, for the moment through its rulers, was manifesting hostility to Him. He had gone</p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">6</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 104pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span><img width="12" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1115.gif"/></span>    <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 104pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">away, and had entered into a house, and would have no man know it.

He could not be hid.”  We read elsewhere that upon occasion He hid Himself, and they could not find Him when He was in the middle of a crowd.  Why could He not be hid here ?  Because there was a woman outside the house in trouble.  It was to that woman He used that curious parabolic illustration,   It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and cast it to the dogs.”  This is not strictly a parable, but a parabolic illustration.  Jesus had crossed the border line into foreign territory.  He was in the parts of Tyre and Sidon, which means the environs. The woman came out from thence. The attitude of Jesus</p><p style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">towards her was the attitude of the Messiah towards an outsider.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1118.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">When she cried first of all He did not answer.  First He had come out to see her.  He could not be hid, and in that first sentence we have a wonderful illumination of everything that followed.  He then main- tained silence when she cried, and His disciples besought Him to give her what she wanted, and let her go.  Then He said,  I am not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”  He was the Messiah of Israel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1119.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1120.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1121.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Notice carefully here in the outcome of the story how that phrase finds a remarkable interpretation; and in the use of it in all that followed, He turned from the flesh to the spirit.  We read it,  the lost sheep of the house of Israel,” and we think, as these men did, in the realm of the flesh.  He had said He was not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  Then she addressed Him, not as the Hebrew Messiah, but with the universal title,   Lord, have mercy on me.” Then He said this strange thing to her,   It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to the dogs.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1122.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="26" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1123.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">Our Lord used an uncommon word for dogs.  As a matter of fact it is the only place in the New Testament where it occurs, and it is a diminutive,  little dogs.”  Behind that lies the whole Eastern picture. The dogs that were an abomination at that time were the wild, wolfish, marauding dogs, those in the mind of Paul when he wrote,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1124.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Without are dogs.”  In those Jewish homes there were little dogs, domestic dogs, pets of the children, who gathered round the board. Our Lord did not use the word referring to the prowling, fierce, maraud- ing dogs, held in horror.  He used the word that denoted the little dogs, when He said, It is not meet to take the children’s loaf, and cast it to the little dogs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1125.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Then the woman answered, Yea, Lord, but these little dogs eat of the crumbs.  Whatever we may think of that answer, notice what Jesus thought.   0 woman, great is thy faith.”  What a wonderful process is seen here.  When He used this figure, He softened it by the term He employed for dogs.  He was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  The loaf is not to be flung to little dogs.  But when the woman</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 145pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABOLIC  ILLUSTRATIONS         <span><img width="12" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1126.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1127.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">said, They eat the crumbs, by that word she confessed her complete faith.  It was the woman’s victory.   An old Puritan father has said that in that last word she manifested the perfect wit of a woman.    Yes, it was wit, but it was faith-inspired wit, for Jesus said so,    0 woman, great is thy faith.”</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Yet by that last parabolic illustration our Lord reached the climax in a process from the beginning.

That is why He had come out to see her.   She did not know much about Him, but His fame had spread   but her agony was there, and the germ of faith.   He took the method of manifesting it, and in such wise as to say,  So great faith.”   It was the Lord’s victory.</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">And mark this. He did not go outside His commission. She was one of the lost sheep of the house of Israel.   She proved herself by her faith to be the child of Abraham.   Those who were of Abraham after the flesh were not all children of Abraham, but those who were of Abraham by faith.   Here that illustration is brought into visibility by that apparently harsh answer of Jesus, which was not unkind.    It was an opportunity for such a confession of faith, and the demonstration</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">of the fact that the woman had her place, not in the fleshly covenant, but in the covenant of God with His Israel after the spirit, and the children who are of faith.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 143pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I <span><img width="12" height="14" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1130.gif"/></span><span class="s26">Parabolic Illustrations</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Matthew xvi</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1131.gif"/></span></p><p class="s50" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 26pt;text-align: left;">T</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: right;">H E SIXTEENTH <span class="p">chapter contains no parable, but five suggestive parabolic  illustrations, of weather forecasting, of the leaven in a new setting   and closely together, three parabolic illustrations of a</span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">great theme, rock, gates, and keys.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1132.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1133.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Look first at weather forecasting.   We think we live in an advanced age, because we have weather forecasts.   Evidently they had them in the time of our Lord.    When it is evening ye say, It will be fair weather, for the heaven is red   and in the morning, It will be foul weather to-day for the heaven is red and lowring.”   Jesus knew about weather forecasting, and He employed it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="56" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1134.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">Note the subject which He intended to illustrate and illumine when He made use of that particular figure of speech.    The Pharisees and        had come to Him requesting a sign from heaven.    On other occasions they had asked a sign, but at this time they were particular.   They wanted a sign from heaven.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">In our familiarity with these words, we may not understand the significance of their conjunction in that statement.

They had no dealings with each other and were constantly in conflict.   The Pharisees and Sadducees came,” a coalition formed for the one purpose of trying Jesus.  They came   tempting Him,” that is, trying Him, testing Him.  These men had nothing in common. They were all the time at daggers drawn. The Pharisees were the ritualists in religion, and the Sadducees were the rationalists. The Pharisees believed that Rome had no right to have  any  authority  over  them.  The  Sadducees  submitted  to  the Roman authority, and insisted upon it. Yet they came now in a united effort to put Jesus in such a position that would reveal the truth of their contention that He was an impostor.  That was their purpose.  They asked for a sign from heaven, and the very request as it was preferred, showed that they intended not to deny the things He had done, but to cast aspersion upon them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1138.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="56" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1139.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1140.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="11" height="6" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1141.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1142.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">In the twelfth chapter Matthew has recorded the fact that the Pharisees did not deny our Lord had cast out demons   but they affirmed He had done so because He was in league with Satan himself. Now they came to ask for a sign from heaven.  Signs were everywhere, casting out demons, healing disease. Signs had been multiplied. He went about, doing good.  As Peter said on the day of Pentecost, He was a Man approved of God by powers and wonders and signs which God did through Him. Signs were everywhere. Yes, but these men said it was possible to account for all the        things He had done on a low level.  They had said the casting out of demons was the result of complicity with the devil himself.  Now they came to Him and asked for a sign from heaven, expressing their disbelief that anything He had done had behind it heavenly authority, or heavenly power.  There is little doubt they were asking for some spectacular manifestation. Some sudden illumination of the night by supernatural light would have done nothing to convince them    they suggested some appear- ance in the heavens, in the midst of the brightness of the day, that would bring conviction   something  supernatural  from  heaven  that could have come from nowhere else.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1143.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 114pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">Now note our Lord’s reply to them.

Said  Jehovah,  I have betrothed thee unto Me.”  Again and again the prophets charged them with adultery, infidelity in their relationship to God as their Husband, Master, and Friend.  Jesus swept the whole of that generation into that description,   evil and adulter- ous.”  That was the reason for their blindness.  They were evil because they were adulterous. They had been unfaithful to their covenant with God, and the result of that was that they were harmful, evil in their hearts, and hurtful in their influence. Therefore they were blind.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1167.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1168.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="11" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1169.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1170.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Seeing all these signs, they could not discern them.

We have studied that figure before in one of the parables. Take it here as Jesus used it. The subject that He was illustrating here was that of false teaching, and what it meant in human life as to its influence.  The Pharisees and Sadducees, in a coalition, were attempting to entrap Him.  Now the evil of the teaching of the Pharisees was their attitude towards tradi- tion.  That made sin purely external.  Here was the reason of our Lord’s constant conflict with them.  The spiritual and moral conceptions of these Pharisees and Sadducees were radically opposed to Jesus.  The teaching of the Sadducees created the right to, and the opportunity for, indulgence in every form of material living,  All their policies were based upon that materialistic and naturalistic conception of life.  The Pharisees who professed to believe in angel, Spirit, and resurrection, had so covered over these essential truths of life and religion with their traditions, which they suggested were interpreting these things, were really throttling them, smothering them, killing them as to vital power. Our Lord now dealt with this teaching of the Pharisees, and in that connection used this figure of leaven.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: right;">What does leaven mean ?

It is important that we should remind ourselves of the subject which our Lord was intending to illustrate when He used, either para- bolic illustration or more set parable, in order not only to understand the parable or illustration, but to put the true limits upon them.

Jesus had taken three of them away from the group.  Nine had been left behind, and to them there had come a man bringing his boy, his only begotten son, demon possessed.  The twelve when they had been sent out had all been given authority and power to cast out demons, and they had done this very thing.  Here, however, was an occasion when they could not do it.  When our Lord came down from the mountain and faced the father, he had said to Him  bluntly,    brought him to Thy disciples, and they could not cure him.”  They could do nothing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1227.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 129pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">When the Lord had cast the demon out, and given the boy back to his father, the disciples came and asked Him the secret of their failure.  It would be a great thing if the Christian Church to-day, in its activity, paused long enough to ask Him the reason for its comparative failure. These disciples did so, and immediately He gave them first a direct answer, and then used this illustration to illuminate His</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1228.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">own answer.

He took a seed, a grain of mustard. The word there is simple, primary.      word seed always implies that which contains the life principle.   If your faith is of the nature of that  <span><img width="27" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1234.gif"/></span> then things follow,   Our Lord had used the same figure in an earlier parable in the thirteenth chapter.

When the disciples said on another  occasion,   Lord, increase our faith,” it was not an increase in quantity, but a change of quality they sought.   And the faith that removes mountains is like a seed which has in it the element of life, which means growth, dynamic.   In Nature the ultimate result of the life principle in a seed comes through death.   <span class="s35">A </span>grain <span class="s35">of wheat must </span>fall into the ground and die.   So it bears much fruit   and if it die, the life principle begins to appear, through death.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1238.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">When then is the secret of our failure    Our faith is of a failing, faltering  quality.

But yesterday our Lord was talking about life, the life of the Church, and its coming glories.  They had naturally been exalted and filled with joy.  But when He told them of that final and ultimate victory, that He must die, their faith failed.   It was not of that living nature that could grasp His teaching. They could not interpret it, and conse-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="45" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1240.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">quently they were paralysed in the presence of the demon.

They failed now in the presence of their own work which He had commissioned them to do, and which they had done until this hour.</p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Follow out the application. The quality of faith is life, faith as a grain of mustard seed.   This does not mean that if we have a big</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A PARABLE AND PARABOLIC ILLUSTRATIONS   <span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1241.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1242.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">enough faith we can go out and say to a mountain, Move, and go into the sea.  A living faith never seeks to do anything without having first ascertained that it is the will of God.  If we   to a mountain, because we want to see <span class="s32">an </span>upheaval, and see the mountain go into the sea, we can talk about our faith as long as we like, and sing about it, but the mountain will stand fast.  But if, peradventure, the thing should be that the actual material mountain in the will of God needed to be removed, and we knew it, then nothing is impossible. Living faith fastening upon the will of God, submissive to His will, and seeking nothing out of harmony therewith, becomes part of the Divine dynamic, and no mountains can stand against it. That was the subject illustrated, and that was the mighty illustration.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1243.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1244.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">We come next to the subject of the lost sheep, and the quest for it. What was our Lord illustrating   He used this parabolic illustration of a man who lost a sheep and sought it.  He used it again later, when He <span><img width="35" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1245.gif"/></span> it with the lost drachma and the lost son, as recorded by Luke. Here it stands alone.  What was He illustrating  The subject illustrated was finally that of offences, which might be com- mitted against little ones. Here He was limited in His teaching, but not in the essential appearance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1246.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">This all grew out of a question that the disciples had asked concern- ing  greatness.  Jesus had taken a child, and set him in the midst as the type of greatness in His Kingdom  and when He used this illustra- tion of the lost sheep, He showed the value of that child. The illustra- tion is a familiar one, and needs no elaboration.  A shepherd had lost a sheep, and went out after it, and found it.</p><p style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">This is applied to the child. It occurs in that chapter of rare beauty, which is pre-eminently the chapter of the child.  The illustra- tion came out of their passion for greatness.  Jesus made their enquiry the reason for things He said about the child, in their bearing upon the disciples, and their quest for greatness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1247.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="29" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1248.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">He told them first of   that the child was the type of character in His Kingdom.

The little child is the gate- keeper, and we cannot pass into His Kingdom, save as we come by the way of the child.  He was showing them this, and in words that are terrible He charged them not to cause that child to stumble. He declared that we had no right to despise a little child, and summarized everything by saying it was not the will of our Father that one of these little ones should perish.  Notice what a revelation He gave in the context, of the value of the child by the eternal standards. Angels, the Son, and the Father, are committed to them.

To make that applica- tion of it which is scriptural is to cut across       theology to-day which tells us that the children do not need saving. Such theology forgets the truth declared in the Bible, and illustrated in all human experience that we go astray from the womb, that we were born in sin, and shapen in iniquity.  The Shepherd is seeking every one.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1253.gif"/></span></p><p class="s48" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 193pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then on each He setteth His own secret sign.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1254.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is the picture of the love of God, operating through His Son as Shepherd, caring for the little ones.  Some expositors try to explain this by saying the little ones means believers. Not at all. The child was in the midst, and His eyes and heart were upon it  and He saw how His disciples were likely to be hindered in work for the children by self-seeking and pride and desire for place.  He kept the child in front of Him, and told His disciples what to think of it, under this figure of the Shepherd.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1255.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1256.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="23" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1257.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1258.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="11" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1259.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1260.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">We pass next to that which we describe as a parable in itself, that of the two debtors,  What was the subject He was illustrating by this story   Forgiveness, not God’s forgiveness, although that is the back- ground <span class="s57">by </span>suggestion, but forgiveness among themselves. This came out of Peter’s enquiry, although the enquiry was due to something which our Lord had been saying.  There came a moment when Peter was overwhelmed with a wave of generosity.   Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him ? until seven times How many times have we forgiven that man who had wronged us We think even to-day we have risen to the ultimate height of generous action when we have forgiven a man three times. We have heard this said,  I forgave you once, twice, but the third time pays for all Peter doubled up, plus one, on our generosity when he said seven times.

Forgiveness, not because of any worth in the man making his appeal, not because of any worth in the sinner to forgiveness, but intended to produce in the heart of that man a spirit like the Spirit of God. In that light therefore we see the baseness of the failure of the servant. Forgiveness ?

It does show, however, that the intention of our Master was to reach, not the general crowd, but a limited company, such as were able to receive it. The word at the end of verse eleven,  All men cannot receive this saying, but they to whom it is given,” did not refer to His own saying, but to the statement of the disciples.  They had said to Him,  If the case is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.”  In the last clause, His statement linked up with what the disciples had suggested, applying to what He Himself had said,  He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.”  We see then that this parabolic illustration contained in these words of Jesus, seem to guard it, to fence it off, to show that it was not intended for everyone  and therefore had a</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">particular and limited application.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1289.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1290.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1291.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">That being admitted, we ask, what was the subject under discus- sion   What subject was our Lord illustrating at this point   To put it first quite bluntly, the subject was that of celibacy, of abstention from the marriage relationship.  The subject under discussion was consequent upon previous happenings. The question of divorce had arisen.  In order to understand our Lord’s teaching, definite, and applicable to all time  it is nevertheless necessary to remind ourselves of the conditions obtaining in all the Jewish world at that time, and opinion held then on the subject of divorce.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="6" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1292.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1293.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="31" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1294.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1295.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">It <i>was </i>one  of  prevalent  and  almost  bitter  controversy  between two  great  theological  schools  within  Judaism,  Hillel,  that  great teacher who had passed on twenty years before our Lord began His ministry, but whose opinion was widespread and tremendous, inter- preting the finding of Moses in Deuteronomy (xxiv. <span class="s12">I</span><span class="s13">), </span>had declared that the meaning was this    A man may lawfully divorce his wife for any reason that might render her distasteful to him.” He was interpreting the law that if a man, after marrying, found some blemish, he had the right to write the wife a bill of divorcement, and send her home.  It is a long time since     died, but men are trying to bring this up again to-day   On the other hand, stood the theological school of Shammai, that declared there was only one reason for divorce, and that was unchastity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1296.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1297.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Those two schools were bitterly opposed, and when they came to Jesus with the question, it was the result of that widespread difference of opinion and dispute.  The Pharisees came to Him,   tempting Him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause    We see at once what lay behind the question.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1298.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Notice carefully our Lord’s answer to that question.  Both  teachers, Hillel and Shammai, appealed to Moses as final interpreter, but differently.  When they came to Jesus He said,   Have ye not read, that He which made them from the beginning, <span><img width="30" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1299.gif"/></span> them male and</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 142pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABOLIC ILLUSTRATIONS       <span><img width="18" height="20" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1300.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1301.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1302.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave his <span class="s39">father and mother, </span>and shall cleave to his wife.”  Any detailed examination of the passage is unnecessary  but they raised the question, with    the background of  theological  controversy.  He went from Hillel and Shammai, beyond Moses, to God. He took the whole question back into the region of original Divine purpose and Divine intention.  That was the first line of His answer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1303.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1304.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1305.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="30" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1306.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: right;">Then He clearly declared that there was one reason for divorce, and only one   and that, to use the word of our translation, was fornication.”  Thus He really set the seal upon Shammai’s view, rather than upon Hillel’s. He went on, and interpreted that. It was at that point the disciples showed they had been under the influence of Hillel in their thinking.  Divorce had become simple, and cheap, and easy  and any man whose wife was distasteful to him     obtain a divorce.  So they said to Jesus, If that is the standard, it were better for a man not to marry.  It is rather a revelation of degradation in their thinking.  They were Christ’s men now, but they still had very</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">much to learn and understand.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1307.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Then came our Lord’s remarkable reply.  He admitted the possible accuracy of their view.  He said,  All men cannot receive this saying, but they to whom it is given.”  As though our Lord said, You may be right in the presence of existing conditions, and of the original Divine intention, and of this strong law of chastity that permits divorce only for the reason of fornication.  If you are right, it is a hard saying, and it may be so.  All men cannot receive it, but they to whom it is given.  It may be possible, in view of existing conditions, that there are those who take that position.  Christ was not condemning them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1308.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1309.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1310.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Then He gave them this parabolic illustration.  It is purely Eastern, and in that way we must understand it. The word eunuch meant guardian of the bedchamber.  The peculiarity was that these men had to be unmarried men, and unmarriageable men.  Our Lord was looking at the conditions, and said, There are those who are eunuchs from their birth.  There are those who have been rendered impotent by the act of man.  But beyond these two facts then in existence He saw another. There are those who have taken up this position of celibacy from the marriage relationship in the interest of the Kingdom of God.   He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.”  Some are born incapable of marriage. Some are created incapable to marry. With them we have nothing to do. We are not living in the East. Then some for the Kingdom of heaven’s sake take up the position of celibacy.  Our Lord said that was not for everyone.  Some men cannot receive this, but He recognized the possibility.  He said,  He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.”  In other words He taught distinctly that in the interest of the Kingdom of heaven, celibacy is permitted, but it is not enjoined. There can be no command laid upon a man that he become celibate, if he is to serve the Kingdom of heaven  but if any</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="14" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1311.gif"/></span>    <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1312.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">man out of soul conviction, separates himself from the marriage relationship, so be it, let it be.

That does not mean that those able to receive it are lifted on to a higher plane than those not so able  but it does mean that those not able to receive it are not to hold in contempt anyone who devotes himself or herself to the celibate life, in the interests of the Kingdom of God.   It must be a matter of personal conscience and relationship for those who are able to receive it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1314.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1315.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Then we look down the ages, and look around.   How often we have known those who have been able to receive this thing, and have rendered service to the Kingdom of God of a most remarkable kind, because they have been able to receive it.   I do not know that it would be historically safe to quote the case of Paul, because in Farrar’s   <span><img width="22" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1316.gif"/></span><span class="s29"> </span>of St. <span class="s72">Pad </span>he argues at length that Paul was a married man.

Do not forget, if any incline to the Roman view, that the one who is claimed as the rock of the Church was not a celibate.   That does not invalidate either Peter’s or Paul’s power.  There, however, the great principle is presented to us.</p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">There is another principle at the heart of it, applicable over a wider area.  In the last analysis the attitude and action of every individual soul must be personal and individual, and in the presence of God. So the light shines over a wider field than evinced in the realm that our Lord referred to by His use of the figure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="43" height="17" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1318.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">W <span class="s7">C </span>pass on to       quite different figure of  <span><img width="37" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1319.gif"/></span> found in verse twenty-four.

Take the illustration as it stands.   It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.”  We may say, of course that means, it is impossible.  Yes, in a certain sense, and our Lord meant to teach that.  There is no need to go fully into the matter of the word camel, or eye, or needle.  There have been many attempts to explain this passage by explaining it away  that our Lord did not really mean what He said, if He used the actual words.  Some of the there give       which means rope, instead of a camel.</p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Hort says that was   certainly wrong,” and Robertson has ratified Hort’s finding. They are both right.  Lord Nugent said in his <span class="s25">Lands Classical and Sacred </span>that the needle’s eye referred to a gate with the smaller arch, through which no camel could pass except unladen.  That is possible, most possible. However, to me it is unnatural, forced, and  insufficient.  I believe our Lord meant and said exactly this, If a camel cannot go through a needle’s eye, neither can a rich man enter into the Kingdom of God.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1331.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">A friend of mine in the States, a man, a scientist of unusual ability, once delivered one of the most remarkable addresses I have heard, fanciful, but scientifically clever, on this text.  He showed it was quite possible to put a camel through a needle’s eye.

Service, and its reward.  The teaching of this parable is applicable only to the disciples of Jesus, with regard to their service.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1406.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1407.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">What is the figure    First, a man who is a householder, and who has a vineyard.  It is his vineyard, his property.   Notice carefully that the picture the Lord draws here is of a man with a vineyard, his property   and he hired labourers to do his work in his vineyard.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1408.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1409.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">It is interesting here that the Lord took a day, twelve hours.

They were all called by the Master.  There is no word in this parable of men asking for work.   The labourers were not seeking work.  They were outside the vineyard   but he called them inside, and set them to work  and they all came in,     he called them.  Many were called early.  They went in and worked.   At the third hour they went in, and at the sixth, and ninth, and eleventh hours, when he called them.  It is an Eastern picture of a householder, a vineyard, and work to be done in a vineyard.   He went out, and the labourers went in to work, when they were called.   They did not ask to go.  They agreed for a penny.  It was a bargain.  It was a contract.  Then the day</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 121pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE LABOURERS IN THE VINEYARD     <span class="s10">101</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">closed after the eleventh hour, and the last hired did one hour’s work only. Having agreed with the first, he paid the workers according to the agreement.  We are not told he made any agreement with the rest, but he paid them according to his own will. He gave every man a penny only, to those last who worked only one hour he also gave a penny.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1413.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1414.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1415.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1416.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1417.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: justify;">We can understand the murmuring  but if we also are inclined to murmur at the story, it is because we have not yet caught the real significance of the parable, or what Jesus was intending to teach. First of all the master dealt with the last men as unto the first.  The first   supposed that they would receive more, and they likewise re- ceived every man a penny.”  We agree that a bargain is to be kept, a contract is sacred.  If you agree with me for a penny  if justice is done, have you any right to object to my generosity   Has not this man a right to do what he wills with his own  That is the only question that arises, as to whether this householder had a right to do what he liked with his own.  The implication of the question of Jesus was that he had such right.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1418.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="32" height="17" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1419.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Yet the teaching of the parable shows that the right is invested in something else.  So we come to that teaching.  It must be found in the strict limits of the context.  There is no question of salvation here. It is wholly one of service.  Moreover, these men were no lazy loiterers. They all entered the vineyard when they were called  and that is specially emphasized in the case of the last called.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1420.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Other <span><img width="47" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1421.gif"/></span> have other aspects of service.      is the parable of the Pounds, and that of the Talents.  In our thinking we often confuse these.  The Labourers, the Pounds, and the Talents all have to do with different aspects of service.  In the parable of the Pounds, every man received a pound, and our Lord was showing common opportunity,  created  by  a  deposit  received.  In  the  parable  of  the Talents, He was showing how varying gifts create responsibility. What then was He teaching here   That payment is according to fidelity to opportunity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="33" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1422.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1423.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">That covers the whole ground.  That is the whole meaning of the parable. That      who went in at the eleventh hour never had a chance before.  He was not called  but when sent, he went in, and was paid on the basis of the fact that for one hour he was faithful. The man who went in early, and served through all the burden and heat of the day was faithful to his work.  The parable therefore illus- trated the payment of reward to fidelity of opportunity.  It does not mean that if a man has his opportunity, and does not take it, and wastes the fleeting hours, he will get the same reward as the man who has toiled through all the <span><img width="44" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1424.gif"/></span> day.  Our Lord was simply emphasizing this one matter, fidelity to opportunity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1425.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">I wonder if we have really grasped that yet.

Mark tells the story of His first coming.  It was on a Sabbath day when He entered the Temple, and looked round</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE CURSING OF THE FIG-TREE       <span><img width="23" height="18" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1440.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">about upon all things, and said nothing. He turned His back, and went out.  On the next day, our Sunday, the first day of the week in the Jewish calendar, He came again, and cleansed the Temple.    When He first entered the traffickers were not there.    It was the Sabbath.</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They had taken their places again on the next day, when He cleansed the Temple.  Then on the Monday, their second day of the week, He came again, and that was the great and dramatic day of controversy</p><p style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">with the rulers. That word is used with care and determination.    It was a dramatic day.  There is nothing in the life of our Lord comparable</p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to it in certain respects.   It was a day in which He, though rejected by the rulers, chief priests, scribes, and Pharisees, nevertheless entered the city and the Temple, gathered those men about Him, and compelled them to find verdicts on their own condition, and pass sentences on their own failure.  That is a summary of events, details of which we come to in the parabolic illustrations.   In these days this cursing of the fig-tree occurred, which was unquestionably a parabolic act, and</p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">concerning which our Lord gave an interpretation.    The whole para- graph must be taken in its entirety, against its background, to under- stand the things I have referred to as existing.</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">We see at the beginning of the chapter how Jesus had now come</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1441.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">up to Jerusalem for the official rejection of the Hebrew people    not their rejection of Him, but His rejection of them.   If we study carefully that story of the threefold entry, we shall find He entered in every aspect of authority.   He entered as the King, as Prophet, as Priest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1442.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All through the story we see the august and splendid and glorious dignity of Jesus.   Oh, yes, His enemies were there in their robes and their <span><img width="71" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1443.gif"/></span> all opposed to Him  but He moved with majesty into the midst of them, and dealt with them until there    <span class="s41">fell from His </span>lips that final sentence addressed to the nation through the rulers,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1444.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">The Kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.”    That nation was then rejected from the office it had held for the interpretation and revelation of the meaning of the Kingdom of God.   They were rejected, and the Kingdom was taken from them, because they had failed to</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">bring forth fruit. The Kingdom of God was taken from them, and given to a nation that should bring forth the fruits of that Kingdom.</p><p style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">After the entry on that first day, and the cleansing of the Temple</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">on the second day, having spent the night in   <span><img width="51" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1445.gif"/></span> He returned to Jerusalem, and on the way He destroyed the fig-tree.</p><p style="padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">This action had created difficulty in the minds of many. One</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is almost amused at the way some people seem to be puzzled.    The rank and file seem to understand it better than the expositors.    Going over expository literature it is interesting to find what difficulty has been created.  We must bear in mind this is the only miracle of judg- ment that Jesus wrought.   We may say, What about the destruction of the swine, when they swept down the steep place into   the sea?</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span><img width="19" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1446.gif"/></span>   <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1447.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1448.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Yes, that is certainly true, but in the case of the Gadarene swine, the objective was not judgment, but the delivery of a man. There was judgment incidentally. But this was a case in which Jesus, passing along, exhibited His power to destroy, not to save  and it is the only case on record.  There can be no doubt whatever that it was a parabolic action, especially if we put ourselves back into the mental mood of the disciples who were with Him   and with all reverence, into His own mental mood. When He destroyed that fig-tree, there were wider meanings in the action than the mere destruction of the tree.</p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Let us look at the story a little carefully in two ways, first facing these difficulties, and then enquiring what were the immediate and permanent values of this action of Jesus, according to His own interpre- tation of it to His disciples.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1449.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Three difficulties have been suggested. First, that His action in destroying that tree was an act of injustice.  Mark tells us,  It was not the season of figs.”  People have fastened upon that, and have said if it was not the season of figs, it was an act of injustice to destroy the tree, because no figs were on it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1450.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1451.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Then it has been objected that it was an angry action, because He was hungry.  He was hungry, and no figs were there  and so in anger He smote the tree with His power, and destroyed it.  It is interesting to see people think that was wrong.  One wonders where they learned it was wrong, if they did not know Jesus   The very objection grows out of a consciousness of the mind and the heart of Jesus.

First of <span><img width="16" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1458.gif"/></span> the charge that it was an act of injustice.  What are the facts about these fig- trees ?  The usual time of figs there in the East was certainly June, and I think we can say, without any argument, this cursing happened in the month of April    Mark says it was not the time of figs, not the time of the full usual harvest of figs.  But there was a kind of first ripe fig, before the time of figs, often found on certain fig-trees.  In the prophecy of Isaiah, in the course of the twenty-eighth chapter, describ- ing the desolation that is coming, he said,  The crown of the pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under foot  and the fading flower of his <span class="s25">glorious </span>beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be as the first ripe fig before the summer  which when he looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.”  That is an allusion to a fact of Nature, with which all dwellers in that land were familiar.  On certain fig-trees ripe figs were found before the summer, which was the time of figs  and whenever figs were so found, it was before the leaves appeared, when the trees were just burgeoning out. The figs were found growing on the stems and on the branches, before the leaves came.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1459.gif"/></span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">THE CURSING OF THE FIG-TREE</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1460.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1461.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">But when Jesus came to this fig-tree, He found nothing but leaves. There should have been no leaves at all.   It was a false development, so there were leaves, but no fruit.   It was a tree of false development. The leaves suggested its fruitfulness, but no fruit was there. There the tree grew by the wayside as they travelled along.    Jesus, being hungry, came up to it, and looked at it.   Leaves were on the tree before the time, but no fruit   a false development of show and appearance, with no reality of fruitfulness.   It was upon that condition that our Lord based His word,   Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever <span><img width="12" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1462.png"/></span>  and at the word of authority, the tree immediately withered away. So much for the charge of injustice. It was the cursing and</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">destruction of a tree that had failed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1463.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1464.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1465.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">What about this suggestion of anger    There is not a sign of personal vindictiveness in the whole story.   Notice carefully a simple matter, but it is important.   The disciples were not surprised at the effect produced upon that tree.   They were surprised at the quickness, the suddenness of it. That is what amazed them. There was no suggestion on their part that such a tree should be destroyed    but that with the spoken word, the leaves withered and crumpled, and the tree was dead.  That is what amazed them, the speed with which it was carried out. There is no suggestiveness of the vindictiveness of  Jesus,  but  the  astonishment  of  the  disciples.    The tree was faulty, a failure   but they were surprised at the swiftness of the judgment.</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Again we are told that the action of destroying that tree was not according to the methods of Jesus.   Let us think again before we say that.  So many people have the idea that our Lord is known only as the meek and lowly Jesus.   He was meek.  He said so. He was lowly. He claimed to be so. But He was infinitely more.   He was majestic with a majesty that appals us the nearer we get to Him, and His</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">wrath was terrific when it blazed forth in words that at the distance</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">of nearly two millenniums scorch us as we read them.

He was hungry, hungry for the things of God, hungering  for  the  accomplishment  of  the  Divine  purpose.

He did this by the simple method of telling them stories, and asking their opinion on them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1509.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">He began first,   What think ye  <span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1510.png"/></span>  He told them a story, asked their opinion, and the opinion they gave was perfectly accurate.    Then He told them another story, and again He asked their opinion, and they gave it, and it was quite correct.   Thus, with a master hand, and by the use of simple illustrations of parabolic nature, He reached down into the deepest things in the lives of these men, and they pleaded guilty, and chose their own punishment, without knowing what they were doing, until He had finished.   Then they saw He was speaking about them.</p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">There are two parables here, that of the two sons, and that of the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1511.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">husbandmen.

It began at the beginning of His ministry. It had grown more and more intense, and things had happened on the previous day.  He had cleansed the Temple, driven out the traffickers, inter- fered with vested interests which were permitted by these very rulers and they now came to Him.  This time it was not a casual question, asked by one of their number.  It was a question asked officially.  They asked Him two questions. What were they ?   By what authority doest Thou these things ?  and Who gave Thee this authority ?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1519.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1520.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Literally the first question was, In what authority doest Thou these things   and the second, Who gave Thee this authority   It was a direct challenge on the part of the authorities to Jesus concerning His authority.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1521.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1522.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1523.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1524.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">While this is not our subject, we need the background to see to what it led.  Our Lord now asked them a question.   I also will ask you one question.”  They had asked Him two.   I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell Me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.  The baptism of John, whence was it from heaven or from men</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1525.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1526.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Look at that question. They had asked Him for His authority. He took them back to that mighty ministry, with the effects of which they were all familiar, the ministry of John.  They knew as well as He that John’s ministry had culminated in the prediction of the Messiah.  Vast multitudes had heard, and they had heard John as he had identified this very Jesus, and said,   Behold, the Lamb of God.” Now, said Jesus, Was John’s baptism and mission authorized from heaven or not   Or was it of men ?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1527.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1528.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">They were on the horns of a dilemma.  If they said, Of heaven, then their question about Jesus was answered.  If John was right in declar- ing He was the Messiah, the authority of Jesus was from heaven, then why ask Jesus for His authority ?  Notice what they said.  They did not yet see the implication of the question.  They began talking, and reasoning among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say, Why do you not believe Me   If we say, From men, we fear the multitude, for all hold John a prophet.  Their reasoning was false. They missed the point of His question. Their whole concern was to set themselves in a right light with general opinion.  If they admitted the authority of John was derived from heaven, then Jesus would ask them why they did not believe Him.  We see the contention. They had not believed, and they knew He would ask them why.  If, however, they said what they wanted to say, His authority was from men, then they would have all the multitudes up in arms.  So we see them halting between expediency and convenience  and when- ever a man halts there, he is doomed and damned, unless he repent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1529.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Our Lord then gave them two parables, each based upon the song of Isaiah, in the fifth chapter.   Let me sing for my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard.  My wellbeloved had a vineyard</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1530.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">in a very fruitful hill.”  They all knew that song of Isaiah.  They were all familiar with that writing, and Jesus based His two parables upon that old-time song, and that in a remarkable way.</p><p style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Take the first parable.  The story told to them was that of two sons, and their opinion was asked concerning it. The story of the two sons, carefully considered, is seen to be the condemnation of their  methods.  The  second  parable,  that  of  the  husbandmen,  is  a condemnation of their motives.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1531.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1532.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1533.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1534.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1535.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1536.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: right;">The figure employed is that of two sons, both receiving a com- mand to work in the vineyard.  One said, I will not go, but afterward he repented, and went.  The other said, as we render it,  I go, Sir.” There is no word  go  there in the Greek.  It would be awkward with- out it, but really it is an emphatic  I.”   I, Sir.”  The picture Jesus drew was that of two sons in front of the master of the vineyard, and he said to the one, Go and work in my vineyard, and he said, I will not go;  to the other he said the same thing, and the other said, I, Sir.”  He was putting him into contrast with the man who said he would not go. That was his decision. Certainly I will go, Sir.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1537.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">I, Sir.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1538.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1539.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1540.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1541.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">We know the sequel.  The man who said   I will not,” repented, and the word means more than a change of mind.  It means sorrow. He became sorry.  He thought the matter through, and he went, and did his work.  The other man who had emphasized it, by putting him- self into contrast with the brother who would not go, did not go. Now, said Jesus, there is the story.  Which of them is the true son of the father   Which of them did the will of the father   Oh, the first, they said.  Oh yes, they knew, they agreed  and they were perfectly right.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1542.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1543.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1544.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Then our Lord made a remarkable application.  He took them back to John.  He had asked them about the baptism and mission of John, and his authority. I have asked you whether John’s ministry was from heaven or of men, and you have said you did not know.  That was their final finding,  We know not.”  Look back and see publicans and sinners, the rebellious crowd, on the one hand  and these very rulers, professing allegiance to God, on the other. Two sons. The publicans and harlots, and the rebellious say, We will not go  we will not yield to God.  The rulers say, We will yield to God.  We remember the prayer in the Temple, 0 God, I thank Thee I am not as other men are, or as this <span><img width="54" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1545.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">Then said Jesus, Under the preaching of John the publicans and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1546.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 81pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">harlots have repented   they have believed.  You, the rulers, believe not, yet you refuse the signs of the publicans and harlots who are believing, and are doing the will of God. These outcasts, these publicans, these harlots, these rebellious ones who have defied God, and said they would not obey Him, have repented, and obeyed.  You who wear the robes and livery, and recite the confession, and declare</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 137pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TWO SONS AND HUSBANDMEN       II I</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">your loyalty, are failing to do the will of God.  So our Lord compelled them to find a verdict against themselves.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">How eternally true we know this to be.  The publican, the drunkard, the harlot, the sot, the profligate who repents and turns to God, becomes God’s son, God’s child, God’s instrument. Those men and women who name the Name, and wear the sign, and are disobedient and rebellious in all the deep facts of their life, are not the children of God, are not the sons of God.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1547.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1548.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">But He had not finished. As He had condemned their method, now He turned to their motives, and the figure again is quite familiar. A man who was householder planted a vineyard. Mark the words, how He still quoted from Isaiah.  He  set a hedge about it, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower.”  It was the proprietor’s perfect provision made for fruit to be gathered from his vineyard  and the husbandmen were those to whom he gave responsibility for the cultiva- tion of the vines and vineyard, so that fruit should be brought forth to meet the proper requirements of the possessor. That was their responsibility.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1549.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1550.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1551.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Now, He said, in this case, when the time of fruit came, he sent his bond-servants, his servants, his slaves, his messengers to gather up the fruits  and those husbandmen stoned them, and killed them. Then he sent others, with the same result.  At last-and is there not mighty power and tremendous force in this, coming from the lips of Jesus ?-at last he sent unto them his son.   But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance.  And they took him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.”  That is the story.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1552.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1553.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1554.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">he do unto those husbandmen    Again, they were so intrigued by the story, they had forgotten their hostility to Jesus.  They saw the truth, and became vehement in their reply.   He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits <i>in </i>their season.” They has passed sentence upon themselves.  It was they, the rulers of the people, in the long succession, who for centuries had failed to yield the fruit of the vineyard.  It is impossible to avoid the sentence.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1555.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1556.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1557.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: right;">For an interpretation of this, implicated and involved in the words of Jesus, we go back to Isaiah. There the vineyard instead of bringing forth grapes, brought forth wild grapes, and he explained his song, For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah His pleasant plant. And He looked for judgment.” Change the word, not to improve it, but to interpret it.

That is what these men had been doing   and the culmination of their false rule and government of the people had come in the case of the Son Himself. He knew what they were about to do. They were going to cast Him out, and kill Him.</p><p style="padding-left: 105pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">When they had found their verdict, and passed that sentence,</p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He passed His sentence.

He first quoted to them the Scripture about the rejected Stone being the Head</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1559.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1560.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of the corner.  He pronounced the sentence of utter and absolute ex- communication upon the whole Hebrew people,    Therefore say I unto you, The Kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.   And he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces   but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.”   There is the judgment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="38" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1561.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The marvel of this is that He compelled these men to find a verdict, and pass a  <span class="s72">sentence. </span>They who had failed to till and manage the vineyard of the Lord, so that the fruit for which God was seeking should be brought forth, they who had said, I go, and yet had failed, and they who had stoned the prophets, and such as were sent unto them, and were now preparing to cast out the Son and kill</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">there was only one thing to be done, that they should be miserably destroyed, and the vineyard taken away from them, and given to others.

That authority is demonstrated by the line of His accomplishment, of the revelation of truth, His recognition of the Divine rights, His restoration of a lost order. That was the purpose of His presence</p><p style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the world.  To these men who were not convinced, there was no argument of any avail.   If they were not prepared to be honest enough to face the fact that the baptism of John was from heaven, and con- sequently his identification of Jesus proved the authority of Jesus, there was nothing else to be said to them. To men who were not honest, there was no argument of any avail, and those who refused the evidences that were so simple and patent and clear were rejected.</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">As Jesus told these stories to those rulers, and they found out what He was doing, their anger was stirred to yet greater depths. We learn therefore that ancient privilege is always unavailing when it departs from immediate and present responsibility. The King’s new teaching here was a return to fundamental intentions, and He showed how the rulers of the people had failed, and declared that there should be another nation that would not fail, but would bring forth the fruits of justice and righteousness, for which God is ever seeking in His vineyard.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1563.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">THE MARRIAGE FEAST</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s49" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 140pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">23.

There is no account of anything that had been said immediately</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1569.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1570.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1571.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">to Him.  Yet Matthew, going straight on with his account, says,    And Jesus answered.”  Again we go back and look at the verses at the close of the previous chapter.   The forty-fourth verse reads,   And he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces   but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.   And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He spake of them.  And when they sought to lay hold on Him, they feared the multitudes, because they took Him for a prophet.   And Jesus answered,” that is, He answered their attitude, answered the question in their</p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">minds, which had now become a conviction, perhaps suddenly and startlingly  so.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1572.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Our Lord had spoken the two parables of the sons and of the vine- yard <span><img width="26" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1573.png"/></span> they had expressed their opinion upon the stories He had told them  and by so doing they had found a verdict against them- selves, and passed sentence upon themselves. Then they suddenly awoke to the fact of what they were doing, and their anger was stirred, and they would have liked to kill Him. And the Lord answered. It was the result of their frame of mind.   It was an answer to this mental attitude of those who were His enemies, of those rulers whom He had now come to Jerusalem thus to condemn.</p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">These were the final days in the life of our Lord on earth, and these parables all move in that realm.   On this third day, He was there in the Temple as the great Prophet of God, the King, and Prophet, dealing with the nation in august majesty and dignity. The two</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="2" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1574.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">parables we have considered had dealt with responsibility.    Now He gave them a parable which dealt with privilege.    In the former two parables, labourers were in view, and the vineyard was the back-</p><p style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">8</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span><img width="19" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1575.gif"/></span>   <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ground.   Now guests are in view, and the background is a marriage feast. In the former, two commandments were laid upon men to fulfil obligations. In this, an invitation is offered to men to accept hospitality.   So there is that difference between this parable and the two former, though they are all linked together.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="53" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1576.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 109pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">As He had been dealing by parabolic illustration with the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="47" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1577.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">of the responsibility of the rulers, and consequently of the nation, He now gave to these        rulers a parable which dealt with the refused invitation, which had come through His ministry.    Still further, glancing at the whole of these fourteen verses, we see their structure.</p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The parable He now uttered was, in a remarkable way, predictive. He was looking over the whole fact of His own ministry, to the ministry of His servants that should follow to the end of the age. That is clearly seen if we study this carefully.   Three invitations are offered. The marriage feast is in the background, to which men are asked, but there are three distinct invitations.</p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">The account of the first invitation is in verses two and three.   The call was given, and those invited would not come. In the second invitation (four to seven) the call is renewed, and we have the response</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1578.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: center;">of indifference and hostility.   Then the third invitation, commencing, Then saith He to the servants,” runs to the end of the parable.</p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Our Lord was referring to three events, resulting from His own mission,</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">The first was that of His own mission. The second referred to His mission as it would be carried on by His servants, and that ended with judgment and the destruction of the city, a literal prediction of what happened a generation after, when Jerusalem was destroyed. The third invitation applied to the period from the destruction of Jerusalem to the consummation of the age in which we are now living.</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">If we apply this parable in detail, this first section has no applica- tion to us now, save as we look back and learn from what happened. The second section also has no application to us, except as we watch and see what happened.   But we are living in the third section, and our responsibility is revealed in that part of the parable. The first invitation was the call that had already been given, in the ministry of Jesus.  The second invitation was the call which was repeated by His servants, from the time of His death to the destruction of the city. The third  began when He sent out no longer to them that were bidden, but into the highways and byways, that all might be called in. There is perspective in this parable, and in that sense it is distinctly  predictive.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1579.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="23" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1580.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Glance at the three sections.    The Kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king, which made a marriage feast for his son.”    The marriage feast is a figure of speech, and here our Lord was using an Eastern picture.

We are not</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1581.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">THE MARRIAGE FEAST</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="35" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1582.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1583.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 29pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">with them, save as we remember that the figure was borrowed from the Old Testament ideal of God’s relationship with man.    The Old Testament symbolism was often strange and wonderful.    <span><img width="37" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1584.gif"/></span><span class="s33"> </span>speaking the words of God to the people, had said,    I will betroth thee unto Me for ever.”   Our Lord now took that symbolism of the betrothal and marriage when illustrating the Kingdom of heaven.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1585.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">In what sense can that be said to illustrate the Kingdom of heaven We have seen in the previous parables how they had failed to fulfil responsibility, and that judgment would follow later. ‘Now our Lord</p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">turned definitely from responsibility to privilege. The Kingdom of</p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">heaven which He had come to proclaim, and to be proclaimed,   <span class="s39">and</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="74" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1586.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">which He is still continuing to proclaim, He likened it to a marriage feast, something           by all joy, gladness, and merriment.

When He first came to His work, He enunciated the laws of the Kingdom in the Sermon on the Mount.</p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">After that He gave an exhibition of the benefits of His Kingship and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1587.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the Kingdom of God in the wonders He wrought (viii.-ix.   <span><img width="20" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1588.gif"/></span> In those chapters we see Him moving in every realm of human dereliction, material, mental, moral   healing the sick, casting out demons, for- giving sin-sick souls. First the laws of the Kingdom and then its benefits.  From that point we see Him constantly enforcing the claims</p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">of the Kingship of God.  Keeping that in mind, then imagine a com- munity wholly and  <span><img width="54" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1589.gif"/></span> yielded to those laws, and sharing in the benefits of the power of that Kingdom, because themselves obedient</p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">to the claims of the King, seeking first the Kingdom of God.

Righteousness, joy, peace.”  Those are the issues of the Kingship of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1592.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">God, when it is recognized and yielded to.   The Kingdom of God is not a place of sombre gravity and dread solemnity:    It is that, but it is infinitely more.   It is the place first of righteousness, then of joy, and of peace.  Like the marriage feast, it is filled with gladness and song  to use a word the father used when the prodigal came   <span><img width="43" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1593.gif"/></span> merriment.   The privileges He offered men were all there in the Kingdom of heaven. He had been revealing that Kingdom, calling men into it.  The king sent his servants to call to the feast with the</p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">son.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1594.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1595.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">What happened ?  They would not come. Here our Lord declared the national response. Of course individuals were answering the invitation.   There were those within the nation who had heard, who had seen the joy and blessedness   the righteousness, joy, and peace of the Kingdom, and had yielded to it so far as the light had come that little band of disciples, and the larger band seen in the upper room later, and the five hundred brethren at once to whom our Lord appeared</p><p class="s44" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">116   <span class="p">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1596.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1597.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">in Galilee.

So our Lord here declared, on the human level, the failure of His own mission.  He, the Son, had come to bring men into that marriage feast, the marriage of men with God, that issues in righteousness, joy, and peace  and they had refused it.   They would not come.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1598.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 125pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">Again.”  There is tremendous force in that word.

The Son Himself was cast out, and cast out to death. But there was no     from the Divine standpoint.

He had done everything.

Perhaps nothing more remarkable was done by that Roman empire than the building of those highways.    We have them still here in Britain. They beat out from Rome over all the known world, and along them Roman cohorts passed, and Greek merchant- men  travelled.   They were the great media of travel throughout the known world.   Therefore go there to the partings of the highways.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">Overleap the boundaries which are merely geographical.

When the bidden were demon- strated unworthy, then the invitation to the marriage feast, to the benefits and          of the Kingdom of God, were offered to all men.

But if men in the highways have no character, no moral standing, if they are bad, call them in.

We must interpret that by this.   When the king      in to behold the guests,” to inspect them,  he <i>saw </i>there a man which had not on a wedding garment, and he saith to him, Comrade, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment ?   A man had found his way in, but he lacked the true insignia of relationship. He was violating the true order of that Kingdom.  This man has been described in modern parlance as a gate- crasher.  It is a very suggestive description. Yes, he had gone in, and the fact he had not on a wedding garment showed indifference, carelessness, or objection. He was not of that company. He had not a wedding garment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1635.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1636.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1637.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="17" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1638.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1639.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1640.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1641.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1642.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Matthew says, The King  saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment.” Then he said,  Friend, how camest thou in hither <i>not </i>having a wedding garment    The little word    appeared twice over, but it is not the same word on those two occasions.

The call is to all, but there must be the wedding garment.  Jesus ended with that strange and wonderful word in connection with this parable, Many are called, but few chosen.” Many years ago, at a great meeting in London, Moody was speaking on this parable.  Sitting on the platform by him was one of the great scholars of the Church, and a theologian, a mighty man.  When Moody got to that point in his address,   Many are called, but few are chosen,” he stopped, and said, Hold on, what does chosen mean   He turned to Dr. L., this scholar, and said,  I would like to read it like this, Many are called, but few are choice.”  Dr. L. said,  You are quite right, Mr. Moody, that is the whole intention of it.”  It is good to have such an authority.  Jesus did not say, I am calling people, and choosing some, who are the chosen ones, those who accept the call. Those who do not accept, will return to their own imaginings and their own affairs.  Those who obey, and fulfil the responsibility of the vineyard, and accept the invitation, will go in as guests in the festive house of God, to the feast which He has spread in His great Kingdom.  Many are called, but few</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">are chosen, choice in that sense.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">This is a great vision, sweeping over the centuries.  Our Lord saw the Kingdom not only as a vineyard, having to be cultivated, but as a feast, a marriage of merriment, and of peace.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="21" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1662.gif"/></span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Parabolic Illustrations</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Matthew xxiii</p><p class="s37" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 28pt;text-align: left;">I</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: right;">T IS <span class="s9">important to have a general sense of the whole movement of this chapter, for against that background we find illustrations our Lord used in the course of His discourse.

The first part was addressed to the multitudes and His disciples. Notice the opening words of the chapter. He was still there in Temple precincts. The crowds were all round about Him.  Nearest to Him were His own disciples, and in the first twelve verses He addressed Himself to the disciples and to the crowds. As we read, it is easy to see the part intended for the multitudes, and the particular part intended for His own disciples.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1664.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Beginning at the thirteenth verse, still in the same situation, the disciples and the multitudes still there, and the rulers with whom He had dealt in the earlier chapter   He began to address Himself directly to those rulers, and those in authority. That section beginning at verse thirteen ends at verse thirty-six.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">The third section was addressed, out of His heart, to the city of Jerusalem, as He saw it.   There it was, represented by the rulers. There were multitudes of Jerusalem folk gathered in the Temple, and unquestionably others. There was the city of Jerusalem itself, built round about that Temple, and He addressed Himself to the city as</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">the mother of the nation. That is in verses thirty-seven to   <span><img width="37" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1665.gif"/></span><span class="s33"> </span>nine.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">In all the record of the words of Jesus we have nothing quite so full of terror as His discourse that day to the rulers.    It is noticeable that He pronounced upon these rulers, scribes, and Pharisees an eight- fold Woe.  It is significant when He began His public ministry, and enunciated His great ethic in the Sermon on the Mount, He began with an eightfold Beatitude.

Every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the Kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.”  They were scribes.  His disciples were His new scribes. He was denouncing these scribes who had bound burdens upon men, who had become taskmasters, cruel even in their enunciation of law. Notice now what He said to His disciples. Do not be called Rabbi.  Do not be called Father.  Do not be called Master.  All these words indicated their mission, and reveal the value of their teaching. They were servants.  So He was sending forth His own disciples.  He was sending them out on that great mission   and it was that of service, not to bind heavy burdens upon men, but to serve men for the lifting of burdens and bringing of release.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1710.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Then in the sixteenth verse He said,   Woe unto you, ye blind</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1711.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">guides.”  Again in verse twenty-four,   Ye blind guides.” There is another  parabolic  illustration,  absurd  and  therefore  graphic.

I did not say Fatherhood. That is a great truth, but the other truth is as vitally revealed in the Bible.   As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you.”  Those are God’s words.

I resolutely change that phrase, end of the world,” and adopt the marginal reading, which is correct. They were not asking when the end of the world would be, in the sense of the break-up of the material structure, as some people seem to imagine, even now. No, it was the consummation of the age. Their question really resolved itself into three  first, When shall these things be ? secondly, What shall be the sign of Thy coming   third, What</p><p style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">shall be the sign of the end of the age ?</p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">They were three perfectly natural questions.

These men start ed it.  They said, When  and they linked up the things He had foretold with His presence, the sign of His coming, His parousia, His presence again in the world.  They felt that His prediction of the consummation of the age involved the winding up of all things, and they believed it would be brought about by His presence  but what they wanted to know was, When   It was a plain question that they asked.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1775.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Our Lord answered them.  I take now only the beginning of His answer.  When they had asked their question, He said,   Take heed that no man lead you astray.”  We are interested now only in the two things. They said, When ? and they did not understand what the things were to which they were referring. They thought they did. They still had their material conception of a Kingdom that was to be set up, that the Roman power was to be destroyed, and the Messiah would reign there, materially. They had no correct vision of the future. I am not criticizing them. We are trying to see how they looked at things. They believed He would bring all this about.  They wanted to know how long they and the world would have to wait. To that the first answer of Jesus was, Be careful, lest you are led astray, for many will come, claiming to be Christ.</p><p style="padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Jesus  then  answered  their  question.  That  answer  occupies  the whole of this and the next chapter. To that question asked by the disciples our Lord gave a long and fuller answer than He had ever given before, or ever did again, showing there was vital importance in what they asked, even though they were mistaken in their outlook. He showed that there would be a consummation, that these things were to come to pass, showing, moreover, in the course of His answer that they would be connected with His own coming, His own Parousia, His presence.  He sat there upon the slopes of Olivet as Teacher, and with that group of men honestly perplexed, He surveyed all the coming centuries. In this prophecy He uttered definite predictions, looking on down the centuries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1776.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1777.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1778.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1779.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1780.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1781.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1782.gif"/></span></p><p class="s47" style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">While it is not our subject now to deal with the prophecy, it is difficult to look at the illustrations He used without having the back- ground in mind.  As we study carefully we find He broke their question up into three parts, and showed when  these things  would be, that they would not be immediate   and then what should be   the sign </span>of His coming <span><img width="12" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1783.png"/></span> and finally showed clearly what would be the nature <span class="p">of   the consummation of the age.” This Olivet discourse moved wholly within the realm of prophecy.  He was looking on to things beyond His departure. He knew He was going to Jerusalem to be killed  He knew He was going to rise again  and He was in no perplexity as to the course events would take. He was making no speculation as to the future.  He clearly marked the course of events all down that period after His Cross and ascension until the present hour, and beyond it.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1784.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">PARABOLIC ILLUSTRATIONS</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1785.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1786.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Does anyone whisper, When will the end be   I recommend to all such the answer Christ gave to His own disciples, and pray that we may ever put upon the things of God the measurements of His own outlook, in which there was an utter absence of dates, or of the fixing of an hour.

What He had said about the Temple is involved in what He said,   When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place.”  That was fulfilled when the Roman armies invaded the Temple.  Then the abomination of desolation was standing in the holy place.  The Master was looking on to the fall of Jerusalem which came within a generation. He had foretold it, and He was now warning His disciples that the fall of Jerusalem, the wars and       of wars before that event, and the actual  abomination of desolation standing in the holy place   were not the signs of His advent. He foresaw all these things, but they did not signify the nearness of His advent  and in that connection He used the figure of the lightning.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">The figure is so simple that there is no need of interpretation. Lightning is seen from one arc of heaven to the other.  It is patent and self-evident, and He was insisting upon this in connection with His coming, that it will be as clear and as patent as the flash of the lightning across the sky from the east to the west.  His coming will have a universal manifestation.  We must not forget that the figure is used to show that the fall of Jerusalem, and the trouble immedi- ately coming on the generation, was not the sign of His coming at all.  Some believe that He came in connection with the fall of Jerusalem, and that His coming is past.  But nothing can be clearer that was not the sign of His coming.  When that hour comes, it will be something self-evident to the whole world. Of course the figure He used took in a hemisphere.  If we watch the lightning, we only see it in a hemisphere.  It goes from east to west, and from the point where it ends as to our observation, it goes on again.

Therefore be ye also ready  for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh.”  Our Lord has returned to the ultimate idea of the consummation.  This portion of His discourse had to do largely with the responsibility of His people, To that subject we come more fully in subsequent parables.

There will be signs that mark it near, and those are the signs of judgment, clearing the way for the glory that is to be revealed.

Then this little illustration shows that the true test of vigilance for the absent Lord, and expectation of His coming, is right behaviour within His own household. Here His  Church  is  in  view,  down  the  ages.  A  communal  relationship must  be  maintained,  and  if  within  that  household  there  are  those who are professedly the servants of the absent Lord, who are not behaving as they ought to do to their brethren, we can go on into the New Testament, and to the letters of John especially, and find words that interpret all that behaviour. There can be no watching for the coming Lord on the part of people who are first of all behaving as they ought not to each other within His household  and who are giving way to riotous excess of living on the earthly plane.  There must be the watchfulness, true fellowship and behaviour within the household, until the Lord shall come.</p><p style="padding-left: 110pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">If when He comes, He finds these things have not been so, then</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1839.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1840.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1841.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1842.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">mark the almost terrible word,   In an hour when he knoweth not,” He shall come, and  shall cut him asunder,” put him out,   appoint his portion with the hypocrites,” where there shall be sorrow, and perpetual rebellion, in other words,  weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="55" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1843.gif"/></span></p><p class="s47" style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;"><span class="p">All these illustrations need the context perhaps as none other we have considered.

They link and merge in revelation.  The first parable dealt with communal responsibility, within the circle of His own, concerning their behaviour towards each other. The     Church is seen there. The second, that of the ten virgins, is still responsibility, but it is the responsibility of individual life that is manifest here.

Then  personal  responsibility, what our attitude should be in the presence of the absence of the Lord, and the expectation of His return-the parable of the virgins. Then the imperial responsibility, as He has entrusted to us certain things for which we are responsible-the parable of the talents.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1865.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1866.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1867.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1868.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 25pt;text-align: justify;">Then,” when the Lord shall come to deal with His people con- cerning their communal responsibility, as was revealed at the end of the previous chapter,   Then shall the Kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins.”  What was the subject which our Lord was illus- trating   He was looking on to the consummation of the age, created by the coming of the Bridegroom.  The parable is a figure of the bride and  bridegroom.  He is showing here the relation to that consumma- tion of those whose duty is that of being prepared for it.  The emphasis here is not on service.  The symbols are not those of service, but of life. Everything leads up to that final injunction,   Watch.” He has shown what our responsibility is towards each other, that there is to be a love-mastered community. Now, coming closer to the individual application, He takes this parable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="21" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1869.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The figure employed is very simple, and Eastern. This Eastern scene was commonplace. Every one who heard Him would under- stand it. Moreover we must not strain it in exposition. There is no mention of the bride in this story. That may give some pause. It is interesting how many people have tried to    the bride in the story, and have said that the wise virgins were the bride.  There may be an element of truth in it.  But the figure here is not of the bride, but of the bridegroom. Such an undoubted scholar as Trench, and others, interpret this whole parable as referring to the homecoming of the bridegroom with his bride.  Generally, however, it is interpreted as the bridegroom coming for His bride, and that certainly harmonizes with other Scriptures.  In that sense it may be said that the five wise virgins  represent  the  true  bride  of  Christ.  The figure represents those who waited for the bridegroom when he comes.</p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">We need not go into the particulars of the Eastern picture, because it is <span class="s62">SO </span>simple and familiar. The Bridegroom is away, and whether He is coming for His people or with His bride at the moment is not</p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">important. There are those who were expected to be waiting for Him, for His coming. These are represented by these virgins. They were all waiting for His coming, they were all expecting Him.  They all had lamps, and at a certain moment they all trimmed their lamps. Here is a picture of the light of that period, fed with oil, needing to have the wick constantly trimmed. That is the figure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1870.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1871.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1872.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1873.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">As they waited,   they all slumbered and slept,” which does not suggest negligence on their part.

They were waiting. It was night. They were waiting for the bridegroom, not knowing when he was coming and necessarily and properly, they got drowsy, and they all went to sleep.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1876.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1877.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1878.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1879.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1880.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Then came the cry that told them the event for which they had waited was at hand.   Behold, the bridegroom  <span class="s57">Come ye </span>forth to meet  him.”  Then we see that five of them heard the cry, awoke, trimmed their lamps, adjusted the wicks to find their own flame, and they had no oil.  Five of them did exactly the same, but in their case there was oil, and the flame shone out in the darkness. Then those who lacked oil turned to those who had it, and said,   Give <span class="s78">US </span>of your oil  for our lamps are going out.” No, they could not do that. This has been criticized.  A good preacher some while ago said the good virgins were a selfish crowd when they said they dare not share their oil. But they were quite right.  If they shared their oil they also would be without light.  The oil is individual in the case of those burning torches, and cannot be shared. The foolish virgins had to go and find oil, and they went  but it was too late.  Those that were ready had entered in, and the door was shut.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1881.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1882.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1883.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1884.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: left;">What is this picture ? Bear in mind that which we have seen already, but which needs emphasizing.  It is a picture of the consum- mation.  It is one phase of truth, the hour when the absent Lord returns. The absent Lord is coming back, when men render an account of stewardship. That is seen in the next parable  but here the absent Lord is coming back, and at His coming there will be the revelation of truth concerning those who have supposedly been His own during the <span class="s57">period of His absence. The whole Church is here revealed. Yet I would amend that, and rather say it is a picture of Christendom.    </span>A very clear distinction should be drawn between the Church of God and Christendom.  The Church of God consists of those who have the oil, and whose lights are burning, and who are ready when the Lord comes. Christendom is bigger than that.  Here is a picture of the consumma- tion, and the whole of Christendom is in it.  Note carefully what we have already seen.  There are similarities between the five foolish and five wise virgins, and they are remarkable similarities. They all expected Him. Apparent expectation on the part of the foolish, apparent expectation also on the part of the wise.  Of both the foolish and the wise it is said,   They went forth to meet the bridegroom.” But of the foolish it is said,   They took no oil.” There had been evident  carelessness.  Of the wise it is said, they   took oil.”  There had been reality in their attitudes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1885.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Yet there is this tremendous difference.

So great a father of the Church as Origen said their oil consisted of good works.  In my judgment that was a breakdown in explanation.  Martin Luther said that the oil consisted in faith, living faith.  But was not Grotius right when he said that the oil is the symbol of the Holy Spirit   I think that is so. Through the Old Testament oil is ever the symbol of the Holy Spirit.  Whether in the lamp burning in the Holy Place, or whether in the symbolism of such an one as Zechariah   whether in all those anointings of the ancient ritual, the oil was always typical of the Spirit and of power.  Our Lord surely used this whole parable in that connection, and for that purpose.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1898.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The great word is   Watch.”  The interpretation of the watching is having the oil supplied.  In the supply of the Spirit of God, and the life yielded to that Spirit, and dominated by that Spirit, there is always the oil which provides the light.  Yes, Origen and Luther were partly right in a secondary sense, for where the oil is, there is the Spirit of God, there is living faith, and where there is living faith there are living works.  But the great necessity is that oil that burns.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1899.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="65" height="18" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1900.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 26pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">Behold, the Bridegroom        When ?

He is coming to do that. It may be a thousand years, but a thousand years are only measure- ments of man, and are not in the economy of God.  We do not know the hour.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1901.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1902.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1903.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">What then are we to do   To see to it our lamps are burning, to see to it that we have the supply of that oil apart from which there is no shining of the light, no flaming light.

We have already considered the parable of the household and that of the virgins.  One fact, however, is in view in all.    those constituting the  Kingdom  of  God  are  under  His  supreme  control.  The  first parable had to do with the household, the Church within itself. It was communal, and revealed the responsibilities of individual members towards each other, of care and love, with an absence of all differences and quarrelling, and biting one another.   The  next parable,  that  of  the  virgins,  revealed  personal  responsibility,  of having not merely an outward form, but of having life.  It teaches not <span><img width="38" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1908.gif"/></span> a genera1 expectation of the coming of the Lord, but of having oil, so that the light is burning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="33" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1909.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1910.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1911.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">We come now to the parable dealing with responsibilities of the widest nature, the imperial responsibilities of the Church.  That at once reveals the subject      our Lord was intending to illustrate when He used the parable of the talents. The word imperial is used re- solutely, though in some ways I do not like it, because in history it has bad connotations. The word has come to us from that act in the history of Rome when one man seized absolute authority by military power, and became imperator of the whole of the Roman empire. Things imperial meant the mastery of a people by autocratic and military  power.  Yet because of its true use it has its own and rightful place in this connection.  Jesus is the only Imperator  not Casar, nor the kings of time, but Jesus alone.  The word connotes a King and a Kingdom   and the idea contained in the parable, which our Lord was illustrating, the truth He was enforcing was that of the prosecution of the interests of the King by the subjects of the Kingdom, during the period of His absence, as to bodily presence.</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">He is not absent in the sense of spiritual power.  We know what it is to walk and talk with Him, and to hear Him talk to us.

Yet in historic sequence this is the period of His absence.  He was in the world for one brief generation of a little more than three and thirty years, the great period in human history to which everything else led up, and from which everything else of value had proceeded, and is proceeding, and will proceed. But He is coming again.  No one who believes in the New Testament can deny that.  The statement is clear that He Who came is coming again to the world. All through this Olivet prophecy our Lord was looking at the world, and His Church from that standpoint of their being in the world, when He, as to <span><img width="35" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1913.gif"/></span> presence, was absent, going into a far country, and after a long time, coming again.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1914.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1915.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1916.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1917.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1918.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1919.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1920.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="27" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1921.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1922.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: right;">This parable must not be confused with that of the Pounds in Luke’s Gospel.  The emphasis in the two parables is entirely different. What then was the figure used here   One characterized by the utter- most simplicity. The fourteenth verse opens,   For it is as when a man, going into another country.”  In the Revised Version the words it is  and  when  are italicized, which means they are not in the Greek, but have been put in by translators to give smoothness to the statement.  Leave them out for a moment,  For as a man, going into another country, called his own servants.”     links the parable closely with what had preceded it.  Our Lord did not tarry between the parables.  We look back then at the parable of the virgins, and the whole impact and value is found in the final charge of Jesus in verse thirteen.   Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour. For as a man, going into another country, calleth his own servants, and delivereth unto them his goods.”  He now illustrated the necessity for</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1923.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">watchfulness, but in another regard.  <span class="s41">So He </span>takes this simple figure</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1924.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: justify;">a man,” He says.  With all justness we may say, a king.  It is the picture of a man who has a country of his own, under his own control. He is the lord, the master, the king.  In that country this man has servants.  The word He used all through here was bond-servants, slaves. Paul always spoke of himself as <span><img width="37" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1925.gif"/></span> the bond-servant of Jesus Christ, that is, the absolute property of his Lord, all his life forces belonging to his Lord, himself at the disposal of his Lord.  That is the picture here.</p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Moreover this man has goods. They belong to him. Change the word, wealth, or substance, but not substance stored, but something to be dealt with, to be offered for sale. It is a commercial figure connected with a king, the man who owned a country, and who had servants in it, he possessing goods in the country, substance.  The picture our Lord gives here is of that man leaving behind in the country which is his own, these very servants to whom he has distributed talents, according to their ability, and leaving them there to trade for him, to carry on his business in his absence, to represent his goods to those who were left behind, and to put his goods at the disposal of others.  That is the very simple picture which our Lord used.

What is the teaching of it   That in the absence of the Lord He has delivered to His servants His goods. He called them His <span class="s32">own </span>servants.  Mark the emphasis on authority and possession,  His own servants,” and He  delivered unto them His goods.”  The implication is perfectly clear.  The goods were left that they might be used for the glory and enrichment of their absent Lord. He had goods. The servants were responsible for their use in order to bring wealth to Him. Really the relation and suggestiveness of these pictures are full of appeal.  Goods, our absent Lord, and His goods.  What are we to sell in this world   Do not quarrel about the word  goods.”  We may say God’s gifts are without money and price. But the figure stands good.  The apostle used the same figure in a great passage in which he told us, not to redeem the time, but to buy up the opportunity   and in that little word the apostle used of buying is the figure of the market-place, and merchant-men sitting by their wares, watching for the opportunity, and buying it up.  That is the idea here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1936.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 81pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">What are the goods   The whole fact of the mission of Jesus in</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1937.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1938.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1939.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1940.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 2pt;text-align: justify;">the world, the Gospel  and not merely the fact historically, but the fact in all its vital power, of the manifestation of God to men in Christ, the fact of a ministry full of the revelation of the possibilities of humanity in Jesus, the fact that He went to His Cross, and bore the sin of the world, the fact that He proved His victory in His dying, <span class="s71">by His </span>resurrection, the fact that He ascended on high, and received gifts for the rebellious, the fact that He is the living Lord, and waiting to come in and take possession of human souls, and change them and remake them after His own image and likeness.

We say of someone, That is a talented man, or a talented woman  and we are describing someone who has some gift, some ability.  That is not the meaning of the word here.

It is a noun of quantity, representing the Lord’s possession alone. The five talents were His, part of His goods, and so with the two and the one.  They did not belong to these servants at all.  It is not a question of the fitness of His people, but one of the riches of His grace, provided for humanity  in  quantity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1950.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1951.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1952.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1953.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: left;">One man was given five talents, another two, and another one. Why did one man have five, and the other two, and yet a third, one Why the division   We are told,   To each according to his several ability.”  We now come to the question of ability.  Talents were given according to ability. There is a tremendous principle involved in that.  This does not mean that the man with the five talents had a bigger opportunity than the man with the two  or the man with the two than the man with the one.  The personal possession of responsi- bility of some part of the King’s wealth depended upon the ability of that particular person to use it.  God will give one man, Christ will give, the king will give a man so <span class="s72">many </span>talents, because he has the ability to use that particular amount of the wealth that is committed to him.  It means this, He will never call a man to preach who has no natural ability for preaching.  I am afraid we often do.  He never does. Behind that wonderful little expression, according as each man had ability, is a revelation of natural fitness, the ability of the personality as preparation for the reception of a supernatural gift, and that is always so.  If a business man has that ability, he will receive responsi- bility according to that ability, which is his natural ability, the natural baptized, empowered, by the supernatural.  Do not be led astray by the five, and the two, and the one, as though the first marks some element of greatness, and a kind of inferiority in the next case, and a greater inferiority in the third.  Not at all. The man is taken into account.</p><p style="padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Go to the epistles, and when Paul dealt with gifts, he says, To</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1954.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1955.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1956.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: right;">some was given thus, and others so  and among the lists, he says, He gave some helps,” not tongues, or preaching, or teaching, or exposition, or actual ability, but just   helps.”  Thank God for those</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1957.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1958.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1959.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the Christian Church who are helps.  But it is according to ability and there is no reflection on the last man because he only received one talent. It was according to his ability. The great principle illus- trated is that of his disbursement of his goods to his bond-servants. That they may fulfil the responsibility of carrying out his enterprises during his absence, he gives to each man severally as he will, five, two, one  according as a man was able to use the five, or the two, or the one.

They reveal the threefold responsibility of the Church. First, communal responsibility, right behaviour among all its members, the ending of all malice and unkindness  to use the figure-beating <span class="s32">one </span>another.  Then the personal responsibility, that we have far more than a name, far more than a torch, far more than a wick which can be dim, if it has become encrusted.  We must have oil that keeps the light burning. Finally, imperial responsibility, our responsibility for the goods of the Lord, for the enterprises of Christ in the world. In each case the responsibility is defined by our relationship to Him. True to Him, the household is always at peace.  Waiting for Him, the lamps are always burning.  Working for Him, the Kingdom is hastened, and the glory is brought to His name.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 148pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><span><img width="21" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1986.gif"/></span> <span class="s65">Sheep and Goats</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="26" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1987.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 148pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Matthew    31-46</p><p class="s37" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 28pt;text-align: left;">I</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: right;"><span class="s12">N THESE </span>parabolic illustrations of the sheep and the goats we shall principally be concerned with all that our Lord was intending to illustrate by those figures.

We are in danger of doing this, especially with regard to this story and illustration. When those safeguards are observed, we shall be free to catch the true meaning of the remarkable passage,</p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">and to examine the process which it so vividly describes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1989.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="44" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1990.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The parabolic figure of sheep and goats here is used in application to finality.

Consider the relation of this section (xxv. <span><img width="40" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1991.gif"/></span> to the whole of this Olivet prophecy.  In answering His enquiring disciples He had first looked down the coming age and uttered a prophecy specially dealing with the Hebrew people, which found its culmination in the destruction of Jerusalem, fulfilled within a little more than a generation after He had uttered the words. Then in the second section (xxiv.       30) our Lord was specially dealing with the</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 163pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">SHEEP AND GOATS           <span><img width="23" height="20" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1992.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1993.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">responsibilities of His Church between the first and second advents. have seen these responsibilities, communal, personal, and imperial. Now in the last part of the prophecy He deals with the nations.  It is not the Hebrew people as a nation.  That nation He had rejected from its place in the economy of God.  It is not now the spiritual nation, the Church, with which He had been dealing as to responsibility. It is now the nations of the world.  In this last section He is looking on to the consummation, and the things that will happen then with regard</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">to the kingdoms of the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1994.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="51" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1995.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="83" height="25" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1996.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">In each of these sections of the prophecy His second advent was evidently in His mind.  It is always there, recurring.  The first section ended with the charge,  Be ye also ready, for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man       The second, in three pictures, deals with the return of the absent Lord.  The Lord of the household comes to enquire into communal           the bridegroom arrives to meet those who have expected him  and the owner of the goods comes for a reckoning with those who have received talents.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1997.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Now this section commences with the reference with which the others close.   But when the Son of man shall come in His glory.” He is dealing now with the second advent as the starting-point, and giving the happenings immediately connected with that advent. He describes the effect of His second advent on national affairs in this world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1998.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_1999.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Notice how Matthew, this remarkable chronicler of the King, has proceeded, and here reaches a great climax. This is the Gospel of the Kingdom, and of the Kingdom of heaven. The opening movement presents the King. From that there follows the description of the King’s propaganda.  His enunciation of an ethic, the sermon on the mount  the exhibition of the benefits of the Kingdom, as He moved amid derelict humanity, healing need, whether physical, moral, or mental  and then enforcing His claims in opposition to those of His foes.  The hour was coming when He was moving towards rejection, but He was moving towards an ultimate victory.  It is that ultimate victory that is here revealed in this final section of the Olivet prophecy. In Matthew, the ultimate victory is not seen in heaven, but on earth. That does not mean the ultimate things are not the heavenly things, and things in the ages to come.  They certainly are, but that is not the theme here, and it is not the theme in this particular discourse.</p><p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The laws of the Kingdom, in the sermon on the mount, are for earthly conditions, not for heavenly.  They do not apply to a heavenly state, and condition of a life after this.  They all apply to the present life.  As we watch the King moving in Kingly power and compassion and majesty amid <span><img width="42" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2000.gif"/></span> humanity, that does not mean an exhibition of the powers of the Kingship of Jehovah in the heavenly realms that lie beyond.  It is an exhibition of His power on this earthly level.  S o as He enforced His claims all the way, they consisted of His claims</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2001.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2002.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">upon the earth.  Thai prayer which we designate the Lord’s prayer moved on two realms.  The first had to do with man’s relationship to God, and the second, man’s necessities on the earth level, and man’s interrelationship on the earth.  He taught His disciples to pray,  Our Father, which art in the heaven, Thy name be hallowed, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as in heaven.”  The passion of that prayer does not ask that men may find their way to heaven one day, but that God may win the earth, and that the earth may find itself in the Kingdom of God.  The earth is in view.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2003.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2004.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2005.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2006.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2007.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2008.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2009.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: left;">In this gospel of Matthew (xxvi.-xxviii.) we have the final  mission and commission, and again I take a slightly altered translation, which is more accurate.  Mark the voice of the King.   All authority is given unto Me in heaven and on earth  go ye therefore and disciple the nations.”  Disciple whom   All the nations. As they come under the influence, and obey it, then   baptizing them into the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit.”  But it is  all the nations.” It is on the earth level.  Do not imagine that takes any dignity and glory from this.  It does not interfere with the larger meaning of the work of Christ, as it includes the ages to come, to use Paul’s poetic language,   unto the generation of the age of the ages.”  Have you ever sat down in front of that, and tried to measure it   The first concern of our King is the establishment in this world of the order harmonizing with the heavenly order.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2010.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: right;">All this is of supreme importance to our understanding of the events to which this prophecy refers.

That account is given in Revelation, I saw a great white Throne, and Him that sat upon it, from Whose face the earth and the heaven fled away.”  Then the dead are raised, and stand before Him. There is nothing here about a great white Throne. The Son of man is here, not so much as the final Judge, but as the King in authority.  Earth and heaven are not fled away here.  The earth level is in our view. There is no resurrection of the dead. The nations referred to are living nations. Our Lord was Iooking on, as He had done all through His Olivet prophecy, to the consummation of the age, showing what it will mean in the case of</p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">the nations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2012.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2013.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">What then are the facts revealed   First of all we see the Son of man on the Throne of His glory, and it is a regal throne.

The King shall say <span><img width="12" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2014.png"/></span>  He is speaking of Himself as King, when He comes with His angels, at the consummation of the age. He is coming. When He comes, He will sit on the throne of His glory. Watch the movement with sanctified imagination, and draw the picture. He is seen assuming the reins of earthly government, and doing it openly.  By doing this He is eliminating all other rulers. No other ruler is in sight.

It is not a question of multitudes of men and women.  It is a great gathering of nations, and He is seen administering the affairs of an earthly kingdom.  This is the picture of the initial process of the new administration of earth’s affairs. Not the great white Throne, not even the Judgment Seat of Christ, before which all believers must appear.  As Paul says, we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ. When we appear under that glance of fire, then all that is unworthy will be destroyed, and the fire will burnish to beauty everything holy.  This is a picture of the King enthroned, laying His pierced hand upon the world affairs, and bringing them to finality, as He moves toward the establishment of the Kingdom of God in this world.</p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">What do we see at the centre of everything ?

Here our minds necessarily go back over   the ground. The title  Son of man  was His own familiar designation of Himself in the days of His flesh.  That is the first thing we see  the Son of man enthroned, exercising His authority. Then all the nations are gathered  around  that  Throne,  which  again  means,  not  necessarily that all the people of all the world are so gathered into one spot, although that would not be difficult.  All the population of the world could stand together on the Isle of Wight, for instance.  That is only a passing reference.  When we think about the League of Nations, that does not mean all the nations are gathered together at Geneva. The King is seen calling together every nation, possibly through its representatives. While not stressing it, it is worth noting. All the nations are there, and are gathered. There is the cancellation of differences.  Old national lines which have characterized us are ob- literated.  Whatever  the  forms  of  government  may  have  been,  and however they may be changed, when the Son of man sits on the Throne of His glory, they will all be arraigned before Him.  The very gathering suggests His authority.</p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">Take  this  parabolic  illustration.

The nations are not      on the basis of race, or of political position, or occupation, or achievement, or failure and disaster.  They are divided into sheep and goats, a division of the nations, a new separation.

Some say He was talking about the Jews. That is a strange view.  Go back in the Gospel to an earlier period (xii. <span><img width="20" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2057.gif"/></span> “ While He was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, His mother and His brethren stood without, seeking to speak to  Him.”  While He was yet speaking,   But He answered and said unto him that told Him, Who is My mother   and who are My brethren   and He stretched forth His hand towards His disciples, and said, Behold, My mother and My brethren   For whosoever shall do the will of My Father which is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.”  We cannot confine this scene of infinite majesty to that small and foolish idea that He was talking about the Jews when He said   My brethren.”  Who are   My brethren  ?  He had told us who they were. Those who do the will of His Father. He was including all Jews, all Hebrews who did the will of His Father, but He was including all Gentiles also. He is looking down this whole age from the standpoint of our responsibility  and He sees them  going  out,  His spiritual brethren, His Kin, mother, brother, sister   multitudes of them bringing His strength and comfort and help in every way  and He says at last to the nations, I cane when they came, and I came through suffering. <b>I </b>have passed down the age in these My brethren, and if you have failed to receive them, you have failed to receive M<span class="s7">C   </span>and in failing to          and to receive Me you have proved your unfitness for the newly established Kingdom of God.  Thus to those on the left hand He has said exactly the same thing, only from the other side.

Why has only Mark given this parable</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">I do not know, but one does wonder, especially because of its remark- able value, a value that no other parable had which Jesus uttered concerning the Kingdom.  It assumes the teaching of the other parables, and so is arresting that Mark has recorded it. Perhaps it specially impressed Mark because of his own character.  His was an interesting personality.  Paul and Barnabas had a difference of opinion concerning</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">TO</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2069.gif"/></span>   <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">him, so definite a quarrel that they parted company.     Paul may have been right that Mar-k was vacillating, that when he went back at Pamphylia, there was some element of weakness in his character.     To give a personal opinion, if Paul were. right, my sympathy is with Barnabas. He kept Mark with him, and gave him another chance.</p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That is a better attitude.   Perhaps this parable therefore gripped Mark, and came back to him in after years, that marvellous parable revealing the necessity for patience, first the blade and then the ear, and then the full corn in the ear.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2070.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">We do not know why only Mark has recorded this parable    and moreover, there is nothing to show definitely when it was uttered.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2071.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2072.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Undoubtedly it was given on that first day of parabolic discourse. The thirtieth verse begins,    And He said, How shall we liken the Kingdom of God  or in what parable shall we set it forth ?    It is like a grain of mustard seed.”   There Mark records one of the parables</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2073.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Jesus gave on that great day of parabolic utterance, recorded fully by Matthew in this thirteenth chapter.   Mark does say,   With many such parables spake Jesus the word unto them, as they were able to hear</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2074.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2075.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2076.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">it  and without a parable spake He not unto them    but privately to His own disciples He expounded all things.”   So it is possible that this little parable was spoken on that self-same day.    It is even possible that it was spoken on the first day of parabolic discourse between others that are closely related to it, possibly after the parable of the sower that went forth to sow, and before the parable of the wheat and the   <span><img width="36" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2077.gif"/></span><span class="s33"> </span>showing the two sowings going forward   and so leading on to that of the mustard seed, which Mark also records.   More than that cannot possibly be said, except that we pause to notice the similarity of the basic ideas in this group of parables.   In every one of them is the seed containing potentialities, but needing to be sown.    In every one we have growth, development, consequent upon sowing, and in every one</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">there is harvest, the result of the development, consequent upon the sowing.</p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The central matter in this little parable is that of growth.    Sowing is recognized.  Harvest is also recognized, but the teaching concerns the process between the sowing and the harvest.   If we have all those parables in mind, and remember how our Lord had likened the Kingdom under these changing and yet similar figures of speech, we are prepared</p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">to approach this. Following our method, let us look at the figure which our Lord here employed.</p><p style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">It is a perfectly natural one, and therefore absolutely necessary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2078.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2079.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2080.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2081.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">A man sows seed.

He goes to sleep, and he rises, in night and day, but there is no cessation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2094.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2095.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in the activity resulting from what he has done, though he is not now acting.  The result of what he has done is that the seed is springing, growing, developing, and it is coming quietly, first the blade, then the ear, and then the full corn in the ear. There are certain laws and forces inherent in the seed and in the soil.   In the seed is a principle of life. That principle is in every seed. There are forces of life in the soil, and these forces of life in the soil, in co-operation with the forces of life in the seed, produce a result, and produce it quietly    and presently,   first the blade, then the ear,” and then the full growth.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Take the whole, and see a wonderful co-operation between man and Nature. Nature cannot sow, and it cannot reap. Man cannot give the increase.  The figure is everything in this parable.   It carries its own lesson. The marvellous forcefulness of this grips us. In the first great parable, the sower went forth to sow.   Whereas the one Sower was the Lord Himself, He is not the Sower here, because the figure says that the man does not know how the growth is going on.    He cannot help it, and cannot do anything about it.    That is not true of the Lord.  It is true of us, and of everyone called into co-operation with Him in sowing seed.   We know what the seed is.   We have had the figure in other parables.   The seed is the Word.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">We have a wonderful figure here.   We need not go to the East for this.  We can look at it in our own land anywhere.

Watch it, until presently the ear is at the head of every stalk.  Wait a little while longer, and it is ripe.  Then the man comes back, and does some- thing. Then he puts in his sickle. Now the earth cannot produce a harvest unless the seed is sown  and the man cannot produce a harvest unless he sows the seed  but having sown the seed he has to wait, and wait patiently for all those processes of Nature which result presently in germination, growth, development, and finally harvest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="43" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2103.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2104.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">What a wonderful parable it is, in the midst of the rest.  We cannot understand it in any true way unless we keep it in relation to the others, especially the first, the one Sower going forth to sow. In Matthew’s account of the Kingdom parables, the seed sown was the Word of God incarnate in human lives.  When Luke gave the account of that parable, as I believe on       occasion, he distinctly said the seed is the Word of God.  But whether the Word in essence, or the Word incarnate in human beings, men and women, sons and daughters of the Kingdom, the great principle is the Word of God.  Do not forget, “So is the Kingdom.”  Here we see those who are His, carrying out this self-same work of scattering the seed.    So is the Kingdom.” That is how it begins, how it always begins.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="24" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2105.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The application is evidently to us in this sense, because He is not ignorant as to the     This man does not understand, but the great  revelation  of  this  parable  is  our  Lord’s  teaching  about  the Kingdom, and about Himself as the Sower, and about the Word of God, the life principle out of which all the true activities and results must grow.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2106.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">This parable therefore teaches first of all the necessity for sowing. That has been said in other ways in looking at the figure.  There must be this sowing of the seed.  The earth will produce no harvest of itself. What harvest   The Kingdom of God, His rule, His reign, His triumph over all human affairs.  For the bringing in of that harvest the seed must be sown. That is the first teaching. The man casts seed upon the earth.  The earth produces no harvest from itself.</p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Then to me at least this is always the true impact of this parable, the necessity for patience, because of this inability in the actual realm of life.  We can take the life principle of the Word of God and scatter it.  That is our duty, whether we do it by preaching or teaching or living, which is potent also.  We can do that, sow the seed, and that is all.  Paul may plant, Apollos water, but it is God Who gives the increase. We need to be reminded of this. That does not say that man has nothing to do.  It only reveals the point at which man’s doing must cease, and in which he must exercise patience.  Man can help or hinder. Man helps by ploughing up the fallow ground by all those processes that prepare for the scattering of the seed.  In a thousand</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE GROWTH OF THE SEED        <span><img width="23" height="20" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2107.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: left;">ways we can help.  All that is preparatory to the one thing, the scatter- ing of the seed.  We can hinder.   Man can even in his folly trample upon the blade as it appears, and crush it out ere it have time to develop. All that is admitted. Interference may be destructive, but man cannot produce a harvest.   Man cannot produce a harvest even by the sowing of the Word of God.   In a sense his very sowing is pre- paring for harvest, but all this is an unveiling of the necessity for standing still, and being patient.   The co-operation of life forces outside <span><img width="39" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2108.gif"/></span> produces harvest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2109.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Let us be very practical about that. Are we not in danger of wanting to see results too soon, and too quickly from our sowing? Have we learned the secret of the husbandman who hath patience as he waits   for the precious fruit of the earth,” that great declaration</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2110.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">of one of the epistles concerning God  <span><img width="29" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2111.png"/></span> are all in danger of doing what some of us did when we were children, when we were given a little plot of garden.  We dug it and got the soil ready ; we planted our seeds, and in a week or two we were digging them up to see how they were getting on  We are very much given to digging up what we have planted, instead of resting content to scatter the seed, and leave</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">it to the forces of God to bring in the harvest.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">And yet there is a necessity for reaping.    When the full harvest is there, when the manifestation is there that the sowing of the seed has produced this process of development, the blade and ear and full corn, then the harvest.   In that sense we may take this parable and apply it as to the Sower, as to the Lord Himself, although primarily</p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">it was intended for those working for Him.    He has patience, and waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and how patient He is.    But the harvest will come.   Then His sickle will be put in.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2112.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2113.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2114.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2115.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2116.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2117.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">I am more concerned with the application of the parable to our- selves, and the first of all to our work. We do want harvest. Jesus said,  The fields are white already to harvest.” What fields     Fields that others have sown before us.   We may never reap from our sowing here, it may be, or perchance we may.   But the fields are white with the sowing of those who have gone before, in a myriad ways    and whereas we may always be sowing, we may always be putting in the sickle to reap.  But that which we reap has not come suddenly.   That also had its sowing, and it is the development through blade and ear until that harvest came.   As Jesus looked out He saw harvest every- where,   The harvest is plenteous, but the labourers are few.”     Put in the sickle,” He said on two memorable occasions    and so is it to-day, and so it is everywhere.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2118.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">What is our relation to this whole process within the work of the Kingdom of God    First of all activity, sowing the seed. Let us be very careful we are sowing the right seed, and the only seed that will bring forth the fruit of the Kingdom of God in this world, the seed of the Word of God.   I should not like to say that conviction about</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 103pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span><img width="19" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2119.gif"/></span>   <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2120.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">that has gone out of date  but it has weakened within the processes of the last generation or more.  Whatever opinion I may have of it does not matter finally.  There is no doubt, however, that He is call- ing us to a tremendous work, the supreme sufficiency of the Word of God.  Let us see to it that we are sowing the right seed in life and in  teaching.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2121.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2122.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">What next   A sense of our helplessness in the matter of the germination of the seed. No, we cannot do that.  We scatter it, and then we stand aside. To quote it again. Paul may plant. Paul must plant, and Apollos may attend to irrigation, as he waters.  I go further, and say he must do it.  But there is a process that Paul cannot help in, and that Apollos cannot serve.  It is God’s work  and it is great to learn to be patient with God.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2123.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Then in conclusion we may apply it to individual life.  Do not be impatient about your own life.  I know it is almost a dangerous thing to say because some people are careless.  On the other hand, I meet so many people who are <span><img width="55" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2124.gif"/></span> with themselves when God is patient with them.  Do not forget, first the blade, and if that is there, life is there  and if life is there, there is the promise of growth and develop- ment.  Do not be impatient.  Do not dig the blade up to see what is happening.  Leave it alone.  Then the ear, and that proves the process is happening, and we wait a little longer, and there is the full corn in the ear.  No, not on a sudden, in a moment is this great work of the Kingdom of God completed in any human soul.  Yes, suddenly, in a moment it begins, when the seed falls upon the soil. Let us <span><img width="51" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2125.gif"/></span> then that which makes it grow and develop is the action of God.  Let us see to it we do not hinder that, but yield ourselves to-the life forces that are ours by faith in the Word of the living God.  Let us wait for the full ear, and the richness of the harvest.</p><p class="s79" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">P A RT  I I</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="30."><p class="s65" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: -23pt;text-align: center;">The Two Debtors</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2126.gif"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Luke vii 41-43</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="22" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2127.gif"/></span></p><p class="s37" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 28pt;text-align: left;">L</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 22pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">is rich in parables and parabolic illustrations peculiar to his narrative.

The story is well known. In it we see three persons  Simon, who invited Jesus into his house to dinner  the woman who, as Simon would have said, invaded the sanctity of his house  and Jesus.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2131.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">We give attention first to Simon, and notice what he was thinking in his heart.  We understand the cause of his thinking, and find that in the parable the Lord was revealing the reason for what Simon saw that perplexed him.  There was no cordiality in the invitation which he extended, because when he received Jesus, he neglected all the common courtesies of an Eastern home.  He brought no water for His feet, no oil for His head, he gave Him no kiss of saluta- tion   all which were things of common courtesy in an Eastern home. He simply asked Him to come in, and Jesus went in, and sat down to meat.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2132.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="24" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2133.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2134.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Then Simon saw a very strange happening.  Luke with fine delicacy employs the phrase   a woman . . . a sinner.”  The word is the synonym for a harlot.  Simon saw a prostitute, to use the blunt word, suddenly cross his threshold.  There is no need to emphasize the fact that she had never been there before.  No man like Simon, cold and dispassionate, moral, upright, and conceited, need be afraid that kind of woman is coming    him  Simon saw her come in and go round the board, and stooping behind Jesus shed tears over His feet, then with loosened tresses of her hair wiping them, smothering them with kisses, and pouring on them precious ointment.  Simon saw this, and it perplexed him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2135.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2136.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Now what did Simon see   He saw this woman manifesting and giving evidences of great devotion and of affection towards Jesus, and he associated what he saw with what he knew of the woman.  He knew who she was, knew what her story was  and when he saw a woman of that character come into his house, and give evidences of tremendous affection for Jesus, and devotion to Him, he measured the action by what he knew of the woman.</p><p style="padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Jesus  accepted  those  evidences  of  affection  and  devotion,  He</p><p style="padding-left: 203pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2137.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2138.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 137pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2139.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2140.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="23" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2141.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2142.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">allowed her to do what she did. He did not forbid her. Simon said if He were a prophet He would have known who and what manner of woman she was. That was Simon’s outlook. Jesus accepted it. Simon associated what he saw with what he knew of the woman. Jesus accepted the devotion and affection because He associated these things with what <i>He </i>knew of the woman. The whole story shows what Simon knew, and what Jesus knew.  Our Lord presently asked Simon if he really knew the woman.  Notice the two little sentences.  Simon said,  If He were a prophet He would have perceived who, and what manner of woman this is that toucheth Him.” Presently Jesus said to him,  Simon, seest    this woman ?   Then He proceeded to show the woman to Simon, and He did so by comparing her with him, and He showed-to put the matter bluntly-that by comparison with her, Simon with all his boasted <span><img width="52" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2143.gif"/></span> was as coarse as sackcloth, and she was fine as fine-spun silk.  ‘That is the background.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2144.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2145.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: justify;">What was Jesus showing by the use of this parable   He was showing that this woman was a cleansed woman, a forgiven woman. He  did  not  pronounce  forgiveness  then,  but  as  something  already accomplished. The tense of the verb is,   hath been forgiven.” He was showing Simon this one thing, for I believe He was trying to reach the soul of Simon.  This leads us to the parable, which teaches that moral cleansing is the inspiration of devotion, and of beauty. That summarizes everything at the beginning as to the circumstances under which the parable was spoken, and the subject which the parable  was  intended  to  illustrate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2146.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2147.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2148.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="20" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2149.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">Take the parable, remembering the narrative. Jesus said,   A certain lender,” and the word is a money-lender.  They existed then, and still exist.   A certain money-lender had two debtors; the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. When they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most   Simon answered and said, He, I suppose</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2150.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">and the word there suggests a rather supercilious attitude-“ He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most.” The Master said,   Thou hast rightly judged.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2151.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Look then at this figure our Lord employed.  It is strictly a com- mercial  one,  money,  debtors,  and  creditors   and in each case the inevitable conclusion is that the debts had been incurred through need. This money-lender had advanced to one fifty pence, and to the other, five hundred.  The proportion of fifty to five hundred is the important  thing.  To translate into the English equivalent is not easy. There were debts, and the degree of obligation is marked by the difference in the amount, between fifty and five hundred.  It is a com- mercial picture, quite usual, happening often enough in that country, still happening too.  The advance had come from the same source, and it had gone to two people in the same condition of need, and they were both still in the same condition that they had nothing with</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2152.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 151pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">THE TWO DEBTORS</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2153.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">which to pay, They were both bankrupt  they owed the debt, but they could not pay it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2154.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2155.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="10" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2156.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2157.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Then our Lord introduced into His parable something extra- ordinary, almost unusual.  What is it   That the money-lender for- gave them both.  Do not miss that, because there flashes a light of the Divine, there beams the glory of the grace of God.  Keep to the figure for a moment, the cancellation of obligation in both cases, the fifty wiped out, the five hundred wiped out     was a purely gratu- itous act on the part of the creditor, on the ground only of the bank- ruptcy of the debtors. I think Simon must have been astonished when he heard the story at that point.  The creditor cancels the debts of the debtors, which was something quite unusual  and from that fact He asked this question, Which of them is likely to love him the most?  He did not use the prerogative which was his, and take the usual course of events, which follows a personal indebtedness to a creditor.  He cancelled the debts.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2158.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="35" height="18" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2159.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">What had Simon to say to that  What he    say is so obvious.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2160.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="48" height="20" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2161.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="23" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2162.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 3pt;text-align: left;">I think with a touch of superciliousness he said,   I suppose, he to whom he forgave the most.”  Quickly and sharply came the word of Jesus,   Thou hast rightly judged.”  The greater the obligation the greater the sense of gratitude when the obligation is cancelled. We see much of infinite beauty gleaming in this wonderful <span><img width="45" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2163.gif"/></span> I see in the parable itself, in the mind of our Lord, a tender satire for Simon.  I think He was accepting Simon’s valuation of his own degree of guilt at fifty, and that of the woman at five hundred. He took figures that revealed the working of Simon’s mind. Simon was a Pharisee, and therefore an orthodox Jew.  Simon would have admitted he was a sinner, but would thank God that he was not such a sinner as that woman.  How wonderfully things persist.  Our Lord said He would take him at his valuation.  You are the fifty pence sinner, and the woman the five hundred pence.  Ten times she owes as thou dost.  On his valuation He took him  but as a matter of fact, there are no such degrees in sin.  Sin is       against, and unlikeness of God, whether the form be that of the hypocrite as Simon was, or the form of a fallen woman, such as the one who came into his house. The essence of sin was rebellion against the law and will of God, and contradiction of the heart of God.  That is sin, and there is no such thing as degrees of guilt.  Or even if we should admit degrees, then considering this whole story, Simon’s sin was greater than the woman’s, for do not forget this, that the sins of the spirit are always more heinous than the sins of the flesh.  The sins of the spirit, pride, satisfaction, are more deadly to human life than the sins of the flesh ever were, or can be.  So the parable Jesus used.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2164.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">What does the parable teach us by implication   I begin at the</p><p style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">heart of it.  First of all, the bankruptcy of all men when they stand in the presence of God.  We are all His debtors, but we have</p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘54   <span class="p">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nothing to pay, not one of us.

We have nothing to bring.   We have nothing with which we can pay the debt we owe to God, consequent upon a violated law, and sin in our lives, whether of the spirit or the flesh, matters nothing.</p><p style="padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This parable, sharp-cut as a cameo as we ponder it, brings us face to face with the fact that the sentence on every one of us morally is that we have nothing to pay, nothing sufficient to meet our obligations.</p><p style="padding-left: 81pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Then if that is the great central truth, by implication there is another amazing thing.   There is forgiveness for all.   He forgave them both.  Behind that there is so much that cannot be said, but must be remembered.  I do not know who this money-lender was, but even the parable of Jesus fails, as all parables do, to utter the ultimate truth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2166.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 81pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">He forgave them both.

He forgave them both,” forgiveness for me, for you, and that by an act of God   very costly to Him, which was all of grace.   We have no claim upon God right- eously.  Our only claim upon Him is     of His heart, His love, and His grace   <span class="s57">and </span>neither  <span class="s57">the heart, nor the love and grace of God can ever </span>act at the expense of holiness.   That is where the Cross came in. It was the means by which He made possible the forgiveness of God, granted to both of them, the fifty and the five hundred sinner, what- ever the degree of guilt might have been.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2175.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 78pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: left;">Then we glance at the direct teaching. He teaches that moral cleansing is the inspiration of devotion, that love is not a mere passing human emotion.   It is a great devotion, and it springs out of moral cleansing,   No man knows what it is to love Jesus who is not con- scious of His cleansing power from sin.   It is interesting that all through this story the word for love is the highest,   <span><img width="41" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2176.gif"/></span> love intelligent, informed, devoted.   She loved much  and her love sprang ‘from the fact that her sins, which were many, had been forgiven.     A cleansed heart becomes a loving heart.   Moral cleansing sets free from</p><p style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">a sense of bondage.   It restores spiritual perception, and is of such a nature that such a woman will violate her own inclination or pre- judice.  Nothing else would have persuaded her to go into that man’s house, <span class="s57">but she went in.

That is what our Lord tried to show Simon, that the actions of the woman were characterized by beauty. Her tears, her kisses, her nard, were beautiful things  and they were brought by a woman whom Simon looked upon as     and spoiled, smirched, and cast out and reprobate.  So she was, until Jesus met her. But then at once all the graces of womanhood blossomed into beauty and into fine expression. That woman was nobly born, because she was born again   and the only men and women of noble birth are those born from above, morally cleansed, freed from all the bondage of tradition and fear, and blossoming with grace and beauty.  All this was <span class="s32">seen </span>in a desire to serve her Lord, and the tears and kisses and nard were the sacramental symbols   the devotion of a woman whom Jesus had forgiven in the name of God, and delivered.  His last word to her was this,   Go in peace.”  So we have rendered it, but it is really,   Go into peace.”  There was a future before her. Probably she never did get back into communion with Simon and his crowd. Very likely she would be looked down upon by some of the moralists who knew nothing of the grace of God. What did it matter   The Bible never names a woman of this kind.  In great beauty, names are withheld  but the personality is seen. Two debtors, both forgiven, but the one who was conscious of the value of the gift manifested it in her devotion  and so went in peace.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="31."><p class="s49" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 173pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">The Good Samaritan</p></li></ol><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 188pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="30" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2187.gif"/></span> <span class="s58">X : </span><span><img width="35" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2188.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2189.gif"/></span></p><p class="s50" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 26pt;text-align: left;">T</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s58" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: right;">HIS <span class="p">is commonly known ‘as the parable of the good Samaritan.

The lawyer was one whose official business it was to interpret law.   He was of the order of lawyers, or scribes. Those are synonymous terms. His whole business in life was that of showing the relation of law to life.   In those times, if men had a difficulty, they consulted a scribe, a lawyer, to know what the law said on this matter of behaviour in life.   This was the man who came to Jesus.  He said, Give me a law that will so condition life that it will be full-orbed, eternal life.   Eternal life does not mean long life merely   it is full life.

They would consult one another about some subject or condition, and one would say to the other,    How readest thou     Jesus said, You have asked Me for a law conditioning life. What is written in the law    How do you read it.   He flung the man back upon himself, and upon the things he already knew, and the things with which he was familiar.   He called him to a recognition of those things he knew perfectly well, and he proved he knew them, because he gave Jesus the right answer, the only answer, the complete answer.  Jesus told him so.

What had he said    Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thyself.”  Said Jesus, That is quite right  <b>do </b>it, and you shall live.  The man replied,  And who is my neighbour ?   He did not ask any question about the first command- ment  he only asked about the second,  Again I see the manifestation of a remarkable intelligence in this lawyer.  There was no question to him as to Who God was  but there was a chance of backing out of a difficulty by trying to find out who his neighbour was.  Do not forget that this lawyer belonged to the rulers and teachers who said that no Gentile was a neighbour.      is no need to make any long quota- tions, but in their writings they distinctly said no Gentile was to be treated as a neighbour.  Neighbourliness belonged within the covenant people. That was the distinct teaching and these men knew it. Was there any lurking suspicion in his own soul that something was wrong    Who is my neighbour ?   Luke tells us very carefully he said this to justify himself.  To justify himself with whom   With the crowd standing round <span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2230.gif"/></span> I do not believe it. With whom ? With his own conscience.  He was dodging an issue.  Then the Lord told this story, and that is the background which is all important.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2231.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2232.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Look at the story itself.  There are three things standing out, every one of them demanding attention.  As our Lord spoke, the picture grows before us.  We see a road along which travellers journey, and certain  events  happening  thereon.  That is so simple, every child can understand it.  If we have something a child can understand, we have something   for the philosophers</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2233.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="33" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2234.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Glance at the picture, and do not forget that our Lord was show- ing this man what the responsibility was, created by the law which conditions life, in order that life may be full. He was illustrating responsibility. Look at the road.  Luke is careful as he says it was a road  going down from Jerusalem to Jericho,” a geographical accuracy. The road did go down. The boundaries are there, Jerusalem and Jericho.  Jerusalem, the city of history and religion, the great centre of privilege.  Jericho, beautiful in situation, a city of palm trees, but a city that had been under a curse of God for centuries.  The book of Joshua tells us this.  Strangely enough by this time Jericho had become a priestly city where priests dwelt when not fulfilling their courses in Jerusalem.  The road lying between these two cities was a rocky and dangerous gorge, a pathway haunted at the time by marauding</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">win.  It is so yet. It was on that very road in <span class="s19">1820 </span>that an Englishman,</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span><img width="19" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2235.gif"/></span>   <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sir Frederic Henniker, was stripped and slain by the descendants of these very men who robbed and wounded the man in this story.  There was the road, and yet it was used by priests and Levites.  I am inclined to think they had an immunity from attack of these brigands because of some superstition surrounding their calling. But they constantly travelled up and down that road.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2236.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2237.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">There we are face to face with the story.  A road about fifteen to twenty miles long, connecting the city of privilege with the city of commerce as it was then, unsafe for travellers  and yet traversed by religious people.  I present that to all social workers.  The road had no business to be unsafe.  What had they done ?  They had done nothing. It may be they had attempted to exterminate these robbers, but had failed  had tried hard to drive them from their lurking places, and had failed. That is the road Jesus showed. It was quite familiar to them all, and perhaps with a great deal of trepidation, used by <span><img width="55" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2238.gif"/></span> except perhaps by priests and Levites, preserved by the superstition of their calling, by the brigands.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="55" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2239.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Now see the        First, here is an unknown man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho. We know no more about him. Whether he had been in Jerusalem for worship, I cannot tell.  More likely he had been there for business.  Most likely he was a man carrying certain forms of wealth about his person, of which the robbers knew. He travelled down that road.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2240.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">What else   Robbers, brigands, brutal men, selfish men, devoid of all pity as Iong as their own ends were served.  They travelled along that road.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2241.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2242.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="26" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2243.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Who is this other traveller we see going down  A priest. There is nothing to tell us which way he was travelling, whether coming from Jerusalem to Jericho   or going up to Jerusalem from Jericho. By chance, that is, by coincidence, he went by and passed that man lying there.  A priest, either going home, having completed his ritual obligations in the temple of God, or else travelling up to Jerusalem, to    his ritualistic observances in the temple of God.</p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">But there is another man going along who is a Levite, shall we say, a secondary priest, one who served the temple, but had no direct function as the priest.  He was in the same condition.  He was on the way to complete, or had completed, his religious obligations.  Two representatives of religion travelled along that road.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2244.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="16" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2245.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="36" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2246.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Who is this other man   An unknown Samaritan, belonging to another nation.  I wonder where he was going, and what he was doing upon that road ? I cannot tell. I am permitted to wonder many things I cannot answer. He was on the road. It is possible he was crossing it, to take another road that    up to Mount Gerizim, for his worship.  It is even possible he was coming back from Mount Gerizim after worship. He was an unknown man, a Samaritan. That robbed man was a Hebrew. That priest and      were  Hebrews.

This man, travelling along, the robbers in hiding, a priest, a Levite, an unknown Samaritan,</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">all travelling that road.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2249.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2250.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2251.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2252.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">With the happenings there is no need to tarry    the attack of the marauding robbers, the man overwhelmed, robbed, stripped    and in order that there should be no chance of his following, beaten until so far as the robbers knew, there was no life left in him. The priest chanced to pass that way.   There is <i>no </i>equivalent for   chance  in the text, except that the word means a coincidence.    He passed that way, and he saw, but he did not stop, but at once passed on.    The man</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2253.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">was a Jew who was lying there bruised. That did not matter. The priest’s religious observances were too important, or else, having per- formed them, he might gather defilement    and he could not do any- thing, so he passed him.</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">The Levite, more callous than the priest, went and looked at him, and examined him, and then he too passed on.

He was filled with compassion.   But he was a Samaritan, and this was a Jew. What did he care   The man was suffering. He might have said he did not have any dealings with Jews. But it depended upon what condition they were in.   This man was suffering. He went to him, leaned over him, and poured into his wounds oil and wine, wonderful remedies of the time and  <span><img width="30" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2258.gif"/></span> bound him up, picked him up, and put him on his beast.   I do not know how far away the inn was, but he had to walk, while the man in his feebleness rode.    He took him to the inn and gave the      sufficient money to cover expenses for several days at that time and that place    and moreover, gave him an I.O.U. for anything over,   Whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee.”   He passed on.</p><p style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">We never see him again, but Jesus said to this lawyer, You have</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2259.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2260.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">asked Me, Who is my neighbour   In effect you have asked what responsibility is created by those laws you have quoted, love   <i>to </i>God and man.

He did <i>not </i>say, the Samaritan.   He would not take that name on his lips.   He gave the right answer; and quickly, sharply, like the flaming of a lightning’s flash of God, Jesus replied,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2261.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Go thou and do likewise.”</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">What a picture, what a parable.   What does it teach ?  First, that the purpose of law is always the conditioning of life.   It is so with our human laws, faulty as they all are.   It is pre-eminently so with the</p><p class="s80" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">160   <span class="p">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">Divine law.  If God has given man a law, it is in order that man may know life, and eternal life <i>in </i>all its glory and fulness.  The purpose of a law is healing and healthing, to use an old Anglo-Saxon word,  There  is  an  Old  Testament  name  for  Jehovah, <span><img width="52" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2262.gif"/></span><span class="s33"> </span>Ropheka. Expositors say that <i>means </i>the Lord Who heals. It really means the Lord that healths, and to health is not to make well, but it means to keep well, so that one is never sick. When we read in Revelation the leaves of the trees are for the healing of the nations, it is really the healthing of them, the keeping of them from being sick. That is the purpose of law.  But supposing we become sick and are bruised and wounded and stricken, then the purpose of law is to heal to health.  Those are the functions of law.</p><p style="padding-left: 111pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">What does this story reveal as to the breakers of law-first, the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2263.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">robbers who attack, but secondly and principally, the religionists who neglect ?  Not those brigands, those bandits, those robbers, were more guilty  but that priest and Levite who left the man to bleed and sob his life out to death, without ministering to him.  That is breaking law.  It abides so to this time.  All robbers who take, or by any means rob humanity of its riches, strip it, and leave it half dead, and broken, and bruised, are breakers of law.  That is equally so if we pass by on the other side of that wounded man, that broken woman, that spoiled human nature.  That is what our Lord was teaching.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2264.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2265.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Finally He teaches us what the keeping of law means.

Studied carefully, however, it will be found there is a close connection between all three.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The parable of the friend at midnight is peculiar to Luke. The illustration of the father and the child is also found in Matthew, but must be glanced at again, even though previously considered, because of its association with the parable of the friend at midnight. The illustration of the strong man and the Stronger is also to be found in Matthew, but we omitted it when surveying that book, because the account of Luke is more detailed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2270.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2271.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2272.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Take the first two together  that of the friend at midnight, and that of the father and his child.  What was the subject our Lord was intending to illustrate   The answer can be given in a word-Prayer. This chapter in Luke opens,  It came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place, that when He ceased, one of His disciples said unto Him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.” It was out of that request that the Lord’s teaching came, and in that connection these two illustrations were used.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2273.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Why did these men ask to be taught to pray  Notice they did not</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2274.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2275.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2276.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2277.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ask to be taught how to pray. That is rather arresting. It is often quoted as though they asked to be taught how to pray.  That is not what this man asked.  He said,   Lord, teach us to pray.” He knew how to pray. The Lord had given special instructions concerning prayer in His Manifesto.  This disciple had heard it unquestionably, and had received instructions how to pray.  This man wanted to know, not the method, but to find the secret of praying  two very different things.  There are many people who know how to pray, but they do not pray.  I cannot say they listened to Him at prayer.  We have no means of knowing whether He was praying aloud, or in silence.  They were round about Him.  They came to Him as He was praying in a certain place. Here in all probability He was praying alone. <span class="s81">Alone </span>does not necessarily mean they were not with Him, because they were with Him, and yet His prayer was alone.  On an earlier occasion in Luke’s record it is said that when He was praying He was alone, and His disciples were with Him.  We might change the word   alone and say, apart, but His disciples were with Him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2278.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2279.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">It has been affirmed, and I agree with the general statement, that Jesus never did pray with His disciples as though He were on a level with them.  He always prayed alone.  It is certainly well to remember that the word employed for His praying was never the word that indicated their prayer.  It was a word that indicated fellowship and familiarity. He never came as an empty-handed pauper to pray. These disciples had watched Him praying, and when He had ceased, one of them, unquestionably affected by what he had seen, and perhaps heard, asked,   Lord, teach us to pray.” Then there was a flashing side-light upon John,  even as John also taught his disciples.”  There is a suggested contrast. John had taught his disciples to pray.  It is</p><p class="s52" style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">162    PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2280.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">quite evident he had devoted himself to the prayer-life, and he had taken time with those disciples of his early and mighty ministry to teach them to pray.   Yet these men saw in Jesus something different. They were not content with what they knew as the result of John’s teaching.   Lord, teach us to pray.”</p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Out of that request, that searching desire, Jesus answered, and in two ways.  He first gave them a model of prayer with which we are all familiar, an abbreviated model, but a full one in another way. Then He turned to the illustrations of the friend at midnight, and of the father and his child.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2281.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">First there came the model.   He began by saying, “When ye pray, say, Father.”  Everything is there.  We must keep that in mind when we come to the illustration of the father and the child.     When ye pray, say, Father.”</p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Having given this abbreviated model of prayer He then proceeded to His illustrations.  The first moved in the realm of human friendship.</p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Notice the recurrence of that word friend.    It is an account of friend- ship.  A request was preferred by a friend to a friend, on behalf of a friend.  A man had come to call on him at midnight-a very awkward hour it may be admitted at once-and he had nothing to set before him.  He had a friend in some dwelling nearby, and so he made his way to the house of his friend, to ask him for help for this other</p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">friend. The awkwardness of the hour may be some excuse for the action of the man in bed with his children.    Notice what he objected to.   He objected to being troubled. Keep the emphasis there. Therefore on the basis of friendship he made a refusal.    The house was locked up, he was in bed, and did not want to be troubled.    That is the story.</p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">But evidently this man who went for a loaf meant to get it.    He kept on.  Said Jesus, This man would not be troubled on the basis of friendship, but was disturbed, and so rose and acted because of the importunity of the man who was asking.   That is the word.  That word importunity is very interesting.   It is the only place in the Greek New Testament where it occurs. Importunity means impudence. That is</p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">the real meaning of the word.   It comes from the Latin  <span><img width="65" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2282.gif"/></span><span class="s29"> </span>which means troublesome.   Because the man was importunate enough, this man who would not be troubled on the basis of friendship, was troubled in another way, by impudence. What for ? To make the troubling cease.  He only gave him the loaf to get rid of him, to save himself further trouble.   He who would not be troubled on the basis of friendship, got up and found the loaf and gave it to the man, so that he went back home with something for his friend.    That is our Lord’s  illustration.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2283.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Then He went on to the second illustration.    Of which of you that is a father shall his son ask a loaf, and he give him a stone   <span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2284.gif"/></span> or a fish, and he for a fish give him a serpent ?   Or if he shall ask an egg,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 143pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABOLIC ILLUSTRATIONS        <span><img width="18" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2285.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2286.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2287.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 2pt;text-align: left;">will he give him a scorpion    A father and child. Take the figure of speech first.  A father never mocks a child’s request.  Our Lord here very remarkably recognized that one element in human nature that abides, in spite of all human nature’s failure and breakdown.  It is instinctive care of the father for the child.  There may be some fathers who do not care.  That I admit.  But take the general outlook on life, and how <span><img width="73" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2288.gif"/></span> that is evidenced.  Even though men themselves may be depraved, they have not lost the father heart in relation to the child. That is the picture. Jesus took it for granted, and He only asked a question. Can we imagine if a child asks for bread, the <span><img width="34" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2289.gif"/></span> gives a stone, or for a fish, a serpent, or for an egg, a scorpion We need not change the figures to-day in this country. They were all familiar things then and there, bread, fish, and eggs, the very things children needed, and were likely to ask for.  Our Lord took these familiar things, and the one thing He was impressing upon those who listened was that the father never mocks the child’s request.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2290.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2291.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2292.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2293.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2294.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2295.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2296.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2297.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2298.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">What had these illustrations to do with prayer   The first was an illustration in the realm of contrast.  Often expositors and preachers have said this teaches importunity in the matter of prayer.  It teaches nothing of the kind.  It teaches that there is no need when we are dealing with God, to hammer and hammer at a door. God is not asleep, a sleepy man who does not want to be troubled, and therefore refuses  and is only persuaded to get up in order to escape trouble for Himself, by getting rid of the seeker.  That is not the picture of God. It is intended to be a contrast.  The record reads,   Because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needeth.  And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you  seek, and ye shall find  knock, and it shall be opened unto you.”  We do not have to keep on knocking. The door is open.   Teach us to pray.”   When ye pray, say, Father.”  Understand that  Father  implicates friend- ship, and understand that your Father is not as this man who on the human level was a friend of the man asking help.  God is quite different from that. He does not need to be importuned.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2299.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2300.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2301.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2302.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Again,   Which of you that is a father.”  You father, and   thy Father.”  The two illustrations merge, shining upon each other.  God understands the need, and directly the soul applies to Him, the answer is given.  There is no need for begging and praying and hammering at heaven’s gate, as that man did at midnight.  I do not believe there is any necessity to persuade God to do something for us, or to keep on asking.  We may say, We have asked Him, and He did not give us anything.  We should rather say, We wanted something we did not need, and our Father did not give it to us.  With all reverence take those words of Jesus surrounding them.  Supposing a son does not ask for bread, but asks for a stone, would the father give it to him   A fine old English phrase comes to me-1 trow not   Supposing he asks</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2303.gif"/></span>   <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">a serpent, will a father give it to him ? I think not. Supposing he does not ask for an egg, but for a scorpion.    The father will say, No, <span><img width="50" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2304.gif"/></span> not. We need not keep on hammering. God knows, and His gift is always based upon His Fatherhood, and upon His love.</p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is no need for being importunate as the word suggests.    This is the only case in the New Testament in which that word is found,</p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and it is rightly rendered. There is no need for importunity with God.</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Then comes the story of the father and the child to illustrate what God is. We may rest assured if we ask, it is given. Mark the contrast.   In the first illustration the man would not give. He did not want to <span><img width="68" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2305.gif"/></span> but at last did give to save himself further trouble. You are different, said Jesus. When you ask, having said,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2306.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2307.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2308.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2309.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 7pt;text-align: left;">Father,” it is given   seeking, you find  knocking, there is no need for hammering, for the door is open.   It was a great old Hebrew who said of God in one application,   He is ready to pardon,” and He is always ready and waiting.   Do not forget what I illustrated, by turning those illustrations round.   When I go to Him, and ask for a stone instead of bread, or a serpent instead of a fish, or a scorpion instead of an egg, or we have asked Him for something; because He knew we did not need that, later on we find when we asked a stone,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2310.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2311.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He gave us bread  and for a serpent, fish   and for the scorpion,</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">an egg.</p><p style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Luke here records something that had happened previously, but</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">unquestionably he has recorded it here because of its application to the teaching Jesus was giving on the subject of the relation of the Holy Spirit.  He will give the highest gifts.  Matthew records Him as saying</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2312.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2313.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: left;">good things.”  Luke records Him as saying   the Holy Spirit,” the highest, the best, the  <span class="s72">one </span>great gift humanity needs for its regenera- tion, and for all its life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2314.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Then Luke went back, to tell how on one day they charged Jesus with complicity with Beelzebub, the devil. They acknowledged His was supernatural power, but that it was of the devil.    It was then that Jesus spoke to them very severely, sternly, solemnly    but He rebutted that argument.  He claimed that what He did, was done with the finger of God. There is no contradiction in the two things. The terms are synonymous.   Jesus said what He was doing was not done under the power of the underworld of evil, but in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In saying that, He used this wonderful illustration.

We are not to suppose the man was wholly in the wrong, so far as the division of an inheritance was  concerned.

It was quite evidently an interruption, almost</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2344.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">a rude one.  The man was evidently not thinking about what Jesus was saying.  There was no relation between his request and the teach- ing of Jesus at this point   indeed the request was quite alien from it. If this man had been listening to His teaching, and had accepted it in any sense, he would not have spoken. There was a fretting and fuming against the wrong as he spoke, and perhaps on the human level it was a wrong.

Then to the listening multitudes He made that tremendous declaration,     A man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth,” and then He spoke the parable.   He was illustrating the meaning of life, what it really is, to people who were largely thinking of life in the terms of the material, and the earthly, as evidenced by that interjec-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2347.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tion. They were thinking in the terms of things. Keep His word in mind,  Things.”  How largely our life is conditioned by things.   What things ? Just things, that is all.   Half the trouble in life is that we think there are things we do not possess which we would like to possess.    No, said Jesus, that is not life.

It is very simple.  Look at the figure Jesus employed.   A certain man.”  The first thing that impresses us is that he was, on the material level, a fortunate man.    He was rich, and he was successful through diligence. There is no hint here of fraud. There is no suggestion this  <span class="s64">man </span>added wealth to wealth by fraudulent  procedure.   One can always expect wealth to bring more. Moreover, he was a thoughtful man.   He was sagacious. Jesus portrays him,   He reasoned within himself.”   In the presence of his multiplied prosperity, when his land was bringing forth more and more, and wealth was piling up, he took time to sit down and think.

Here our Lord was dealing with life. A man’s life consisteth not in fruits and barns and corn and goods.  He may have them in abundance, but they do not hold life they do not make it consistent.  A man’s life does not consist in those things.  He can have them and multiply them and store them  but that is not life.  Our Lord used a word here for life.  The man talked about his soul. They are two different words here. The man’s word referred to his personality, and he used the word <span><img width="40" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2393.gif"/></span> soul.  That is only mental.

This man did not talk about his spirit, but his soul, the mental side of him. It is a wonderful side through which we have appreciation of all things of mental activity.   My soul,” my mind  and he thought that was his essential life.  It is not.  The psychic is always the mental conscious- ness.     wrote in one of his letters about the   natural man.”  We should be perfectly correct if we translated that   the psychic man <span><img width="12" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2395.png"/></span><span class="s33"> </span>that is his word, the man who lives in the mental only.

Other parables have moved in the same realm. In the twenth-fourth and twenty-fifth chapters of Matthew we considered three, one communal, having to do with inter-relationships within His Kingdom    <span class="s30">one </span>personal, dealing with the supply of oil for lamps    and one imperial, concerning the talents entrusted to His own.   When considering the first of these in Matthew, we postponed a full consideration, because the teaching here in Luke is fuller than that given in Matthew.    Matthew  recorded briefly this parable as our Lord uttered it in the Olivet prophecy.</p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Luke gives it as our Lord had uttered it in an earlier part of His ministry.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2424.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2425.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2426.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2427.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2428.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">This parable has a value    its own.  What was our Lord intending to illustrate   Notice how the record begins.    And Peter said, Lord, speakest Thou  <span><img width="19" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2429.gif"/></span> parable unto us, or even unto all     What parable Certainly not the one we are now considering, because He had not then uttered it. Immediately preceding that question is a parable</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2430.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Jesus had been uttering, and the question of Peter concerned the application of that previous parable, which dealt with the subject of fidelity to an absent Lord. Matthew Henry once said,     Thank God for Peter. He was always asking questions.” His questions always brought forth wonderful answers.   This was a perfectly fair question,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2431.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2432.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2433.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2434.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2435.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2436.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Speakest Thou this parable unto us, or even unto all      It is one that faces <span class="s7">US </span>as we consider the parable. This present study is the answer to the question about fidelity to an absent Lord.    The  us referred to the twelve chosen apostles, representatives of those who should be the successors in the long history.    Is the teaching of that parable restricted to such, or does it apply to all   <span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2437.gif"/></span>  Whether the   all means all men, or all disciples, we cannot say.    Peter was definitely seeking to know if our Lord’s teaching was intended to lay responsi- bility on the apostles, and those who should be called after them to certain definite spiritual authority within the Church of God, or whether it applied to all the Church.    That is the background of the parable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2438.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2439.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2440.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="11" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2441.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 10pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">Notice how our Lord answered it.   He did so by asking a question which, in a sense, He did not answer at all.   Peter said, Who is that teaching for   Is it for us, or    ? Jesus said,   Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall set over his household</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The question is open.  Does what He is now going to say apply to a</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 155pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE WATCHFUL SERVANTS         <span><img width="18" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2442.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2443.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">special company, called to specific service, or does it apply to all Our Lord left it quite open. In effect He said, What I have said applies to every steward in the household who is faithful and true, whether in a special sense called to ministry, or not.    I think in the last analysis the supreme value of the parable is for such, but it applies to others as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: left;">The picture our Lord here drew was of a household, which we must interpret by the East.   There the household is a very different thing to what it is here.   The household was composed of a lord, a master, the supreme one over all those who constituted the house- hold, a despot not in any bad sense, but in a good sense, signifying complete and unquestioned and unqualified authority. Then in the household there was the office of stewardship, those under the lord who were the representatives of the lord.   They were stewards of the property of their lord.   A steward not only had charge of these things, he was responsible for their administration in the household.    In the Eastern countries, too, the position of steward was often held by slaves, bond-servants.   In this story the word used for servant is   <span><img width="68" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2444.png"/></span><span class="s33"> </span>slave.  Those who were representatives of the ruler, the lord, were in complete surrender and subservience. That was the household.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2445.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Now in that household the responsibility that rested upon those who were stewards, being bond-servants, was that of watching over the life of   in the household, and of feeding all in that household. In the teaching of Jesus, taking the figure, we see that it was applicable to all in a household.

There is a sense in which this parable is applicable to all in the household.  That is a great phrase,   the household of God,” which is the living Church.  Every member of the Church is responsible for the other.  The one sentiment which is for evermore denied at the door of the Church is the sentiment that is never recommended by the lips that first used it,   Am I my brother’s keeper    We should remember that.  Yet there is the attitude, the peril, the possibility of au attitude in those words,  Am I my brother’s keeper ?   That is not true in the Christian Church.  If it is true, then there are stewards who are failing.  We are all responsible for each other in the great household of God.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2462.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2463.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2464.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2465.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2466.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2467.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="30" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2468.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2469.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: right;">Yet it is true according to New Testament teaching, that God has called by the Holy Spirit, and set apart certain within the Church who are in specific <span class="s25">sense </span>in  oversight.  That is the meaning of the word <span><img width="37" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2470.gif"/></span>  Bishop and presbyter are synonymous terms in the New Testa- ment.  They meant those who have oversight.  That is what the writer of the epistle said,   Remember them that had the rule over you.” Who were they  Those   which spake unto you the word of God.” These orders of Christian ministry emerge clearly in the New Testa- ment. We have mixed them terribly, and yet their essential values remain, those who are called upon  to watch in behalf of the souls  of the household of God.”  Whereas the application of this parable of Jesus is unquestionably to all, I cannot study it without being con- vinced that its special application is to those whom we to-day call ministers.  We are mistaken if we think ministers are servants of men. We are servants of the Lord,     your servants for His sake,” in His interests.

The Lord used that distributive method in order to show that it applied to all those who take the position of bond-service, or stewardship   whether specially or generally, but specially to those who are called.  In the book of the Acts we have that wonderful story in the twentieth chapter of Paul calling together the elders of the Church at Ephesus, and talking to them.

This is the only occurrence of the word in the New Testament.  The clergy, there- fore, according to the New Testament, are not the special ministers of the Church, but the rank and file of the members.  The Church members here are in the clergy, and the minister is not   The clergy means the laity.  It has to do with the inheritance, and the elders are not to lord it over the clergy, but to make themselves   ensamples to the flock.”   And when the chief Shepherd shall be manifested, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away.”</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Those two references show how the teaching of Jesus has special and first-hand application.  To every brother in the ministry, and Sunday School teacher, and those preparing for this sacred work, it is borne in upon us as we study these words of Jesus, that we feed the flock of God.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2487.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="35" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2488.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">It may be said, Surely the picture cannot be a true one, that within the household were those beating their men-servants and maid- servants, and eating and drinking, and becoming drunken.  It is rather startling.  But consider the history of the Christian Church.  Again and again within the Church, on the part of those supposed to be stewards and fellow-watchers, this very thing has literally taken place  the beat- ing, and beating to death, in the supposed interest of Christ Himself. One of the things that gives me cause for hope and rejoicing to-day is that there is far less of it than there was when I was young.  I can remember the extreme bitterness manifested to those who were of the household of God by others, and how men mauled each other. They are still doing it.      is an awful possibility of being in this fellowship, and so failing that our treatment of our fellow-men is utterly antagonistic to the spirit and genius of Christianity.  Study the history of the Church to see to what I am referring.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="36" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2489.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2490.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">What then are our duties ?

Again care is needed to discover the subject which our Lord intended to illustrate.  The figures of the fig-tree and the vineyard were prominent nationally at that time.  One might be familiar with the song of the vineyard in the fifth chapter of the prophecy of Isaiah, without realizing that this parable as to method is closely connected with it. There is no doubt that in the mind of our Lord thoughts of Isaiah’s song are to be found, and that His parable in certain ways was an</span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">adaptation of that song of Isaiah.</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">This parable might be applied to the nation of Israel, and to God’s dealing with that people.  While not denying that there may be such an application, unquestionably there is that implication; if that be all, we do not really understand at what our Lord was aiming.  So we must give attention to the context of His parable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2496.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2497.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">In doing so we see at once the <span><img width="63" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2498.gif"/></span> was individual rather than national. The larger application is of course involved, but the national entity has to be measured by individuals, and its strength measured by the individual unit.  As it is true that every chain is as strong as its weakest link, and no stronger  and every fortress is as strong as its least guarded gate, and no stronger    the nation is as strong as the individual.  If it is weak individually, the weakness of the national life is created. So there is the closest relationship between the national and individual application.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2499.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">However, we <span class="s25">are </span>concerned to know why our Lord, at this point, used this parable  and also to mark the relationship of all that lies round about it.

We have no right to say such a thing.  People said that the earthquake in San Francisco, and the fire that followed, was the judgment of God on that city. Nothing of the kind.  God does not deal with men like that now.  That is not His method.  Here in this parable we see the truth concerning all life, and though we may never be slain by Pilate’s soldiers, or be crushed by the falling of houses in an earthquake, we may perish unless we repent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2527.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2528.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: right;">Look at the parable. What a <span><img width="73" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2529.gif"/></span> clear and succinct revelation it is.  It is a simple and human story.  What is the picture presented   First we see a proprietor, and his rights are revealed. A certain man had a fig-tree.”  It was his, planted in his vineyard.</p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">It derived all its resources from his soil, his property.  There are three rights of the proprietor, taking the picture simply.</p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">There is first the absolute right of the proprietor to his own property. It was his soil. It was his vineyard. It was his fig-tree. It belonged to him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2530.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2531.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Secondly we see, growing out of the absolute right, the moral right of expectation.  Why did he give that fig-tree room in his vineyard Because he expected figs, fruit.  If a man plants a fig-tree in his garden, he expects figs.  We can change the figure.  If a man plants an <span><img width="34" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2532.gif"/></span><span class="s29"> </span>tree in his garden, what does he do it for  Apples. The moral ex- pectation is perfectly justifiable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2533.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="55" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2534.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">But in this parable there is another right, a punitive right of the proprietor to destroy that which fails. That is what the proprietor said to the vinedresser, the one in charge of his vineyard.  For three years I have sought fruit on this fig-tree, and found none.  My right of expectation has been trifled with, and thwarted, in spite of my patience for three years. Cut it down. Who will gainsay his right to do it   His right was created not merely because it brought forth no fruit, but because it        the ground.  That means two things. Another tree, occupying that same space and soil, will bear fruit, and because it is robbing the soil of its riches, and bringing forth no fruit, it is ruining the soil.  Those are the proprietor’s rights as we look at the picture.  There is no need to make <span class="s41">any </span>application.</p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: right;">Now in the parable there is interference, gracious, beneficent, but just, made by an intercessor. What does he ask ? An opportunity to provoke that failing tree to such action as shall produce the fruit.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2535.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2536.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2537.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2538.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 9pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">Let it alone this year also till I shall dig about it,” disturb it <span><img width="12" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2539.png"/></span> and dung it,” fertilize it.  That is the plea of the intercessor.  Is that all <span class="s29">No,  </span>If it bear fruit thenceforth, well.”  That is what thou hast been expecting.

If a tree bears fruit, it will still keep its place  and functioning accord- ing to the intention of the proprietor, he will be satisfied.  If it fails, in spite of the intercessor’s plea, and his ministry, there is only one thing to do. A fruitless tree must not be allowed to      the ground.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2545.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2546.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Here the truth concerning Iife is revealed, whether it be individual or national matters nothing. The first fact is, the rights of God. Are people tired of hearing that   I thank God that it is being said with new emphasis again to-day. A man has no rights apart from the rights of God.  The only right man has is to be damned   That is not the only thing. We have no right to expect anything, except for the mercy and grace of God.  God’s rights are the absolute rights of proprietorship. We are His by creation. We have no power of personality that is not created by God.  Any essential power of per- sonality is the result of Divine creation, and we are in His vineyard. This world is His. We have lived in it so many years. We have breathed His air. We have known His sunlight, We have benefited by His laws. Here we are, living in His world, His creation, His property, and deriving all the resources of personality from that which is His.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2547.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2548.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2549.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2550.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: left;">Has He any moral right of expectation   What does He expect When looking at the fig-tree I used the word of the parable and said we could change it to suit this Western clime in which we live.  What did that man want from that tree  Figs. What is God looking for in man ?  What is He looking for in me ?  A man.  What is He looking for in you ?  A man, a woman, a youth, a child.  When He said,  Let Us make man,” He is looking for the realizing of the meaning of our own life, according to His own creation.  Suffer me an illustration, often used.  When a boy in Sunday School, we used to sing,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2551.gif"/></span></p><p class="s48" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 138pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">I want to be an angel,</p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 137pt;text-indent: 9pt;text-align: left;">And with the angels stand.

God never intended us to be angels, and He never intends us to be.  He does not want angels when He makes men.  He wants men.  Someone may say I am lowering the standard. No, I am not. What is a man  We have only one answer. Jesus is the revelation.  That is what God wants when He comes into His garden seeking fruit, from you, from me  likeness to Jesus.

Luke has recorded a remarkable section (xiv.-xvii. <span class="s12">IO</span><span class="s13">), </span>telling of happenings on one Sunday afternoon in the life of our Lord. I think it was the last Sunday in His public ministry, of which we have any record. This</p><p style="padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">parable was given on that afternoon.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2570.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2571.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Our Lord had been invited into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees to eat bread, and   they were watching Him.”  The first thing then suggested is that it was an occasion of hospitality, a Sabbath  afternoon  reception.  At that time one mark of the degeneracy of the Hebrew people was that they encroached upon the Sabbath day for social reception.  It is a mark of degeneracy to-day very often, in the Christian Church. Our Lord went to this house. We can go to such gatherings too if we do what He did there.  Guests and host were there, and it is evident that the hospitality offered to Jesus, which He accepted when He went into the house, was of a sinister nature  because there was a man there whom no ruler would have asked, except for an ulterior reason-a man with dropsy.  Luke tells us that they watched Jesus to see what He would do with that man. He healed him, and let him go.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Then in that house, which was for the moment a house of hospi-</p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">tality, where guests were assembled, Jesus did the most unconventional thing on record.  He first criticized the guests for their bad manners, and then His host for the false principle upon which he had issued his invitations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="33" height="20" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2572.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">As He talked to them, He had spoken about a marriage feast, about dinner, and about supper.  It was all in the realm of hospitality. He was there in the house, with a sinister motive in the invitation and the other guests were there, seating themselves round those</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2573.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2574.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: right;">sided tables of those homes, where there was one place of pre-eminence. We are told Jesus marked how they chose the chief seats.  The word marked  is a good translation, though it does not merely mean He</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2575.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 48pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">saw.  He watched them. They watched Him, but He watched them and everything was in the realm of hospitality.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2576.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">As He criticized the guests and the host, He revealed two prin- ciples of social order.  He revealed first that self-emptying is the true secret of exaltation. Office seekers were excluded  those wanting the chief places were dismissed.  Those not seeking were to have the chief places in social life.  Self-emptying is the secret of exaltation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2577.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="37" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2578.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Then when He turned to the host, He showed that self-emptying is the secret of hospitality.  In that story there is one little word, twice repeated.   <span class="s64">Lest      </span>honourable man than thou be bidden.”  That</p><p class="s30" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">180  <span class="p">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2579.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">is <span class="s41">the </span>danger.  When He came to the host He said, Do not call your friends and brethren, or your rich neighbours,  lest <span><img width="32" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2580.gif"/></span> they also bid thee again.”  But that is generally why we do ask people. We expect them to ask us again.  Said Christ, If people act on that basis, they cut the nerve of hospitality.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2581.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="68" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2582.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2583.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2584.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="62" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2585.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">It was at that moment someone at that feast, said,   Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the Kingdom of God.” There are different opinions what that exclamation really meant.  Some look upon it as a satirical exclamation.  Personally I believe strongly that it was <span class="s39">a </span>genuine         of admiration. Some person in that company listened to Him, and saw through the things He had said, things of the simplest, and yet most searching   an order of life quite different to the one with which people were familiar  a new social order altogether, in which the places of honour went only to        people, an order of life in which hospitality was completely self-emptied, and never self-seeking.  I think somebody saw it, and cried <span><img width="30" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2586.png"/></span> Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the Kingdom of God.”  It was an intelligent remark. A man saw that the order revealed was the order of the Kingship of God, and the Kingdom of God.  Someone saw the beauty of the ideal, of a social order mastered by these principles.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2587.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2588.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">We come now to the parable.   But He said unto him.” The parable  was  an  answer  to  that  exclamation,  and  becomes  a  most searching and revealing one. Our Lord took His story from the realm in which He found Himself, that of hospitality.  There in the house the guests were gathered, bad-mannered  and a host who did not understand hospitality. It was a social occasion, a feast. So <span class="s41">our Lord said,  </span>in effect, Let Me tell you a story.  This story was an answer to that exclamation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="44" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2589.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2590.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 105pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">What was the figure employed ?  It was purely Eastern. A host prepares a supper, and issues his invitations to that supper.  All the guests decline, making various excuses.  Surely there was      in the heart of our Lord, as seen in the illustrations.  The host was angry, and sent his servants with invitations to new guests, the poor, the maimed, the blind, and the lame.  Notice these were the people whom He had told His host he should ask, when he made a feast.  The report was made to him, This is done as thou commanded, and yet there is room.  Then the last words of the host,   Constrain them to come in that my house may be filled.  For I say unto you, that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.”</p><p style="padding-left: 119pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">Taking that as a story, without thinking of any application for</p><p style="padding-left: 104pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the moment, it is a most unusual one, and our Lord intended it to be such.  Common experience would contradict it, that any host who had a supper, and sent out invitations, everyone invited should decline the invitation.  Did a thing like that ever happen ?  Immediately we are face to face with this fact, that implicated in the story is a recog- nition of hostility toward the host on the part of those who were</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 156pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE GREAT SUPPER            <span class="s85">181</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">bidden. They began to make excuses. They were only excuses, but they made them. They declined. They would not come. Why not ? There is only one answer, that they did not like their host.   One cannot argue anything else.   The neglect lies deeper than that of a supper table.  There is some objection to the one who sent out the invitation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2591.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2592.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2593.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2594.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: left;">Jesus told this unusual story when someone really admired the ideal of the Kingdom of God.   He did not deny what this person has said as to the blessedness of the Kingdom of God.   In His great Mani- festo He struck the key-note in the word   Blessed,” happy, prosperous, as the Greek word means.   That is the purpose, the meaning of the Kingdom of God, blessedness.   Here in two social illustrations some man saw the new order, and said, There is the secret of happiness blessed is he who shall live under those conditions.   Our Lord was not denying this. What was He doing   He was revealing the human heart, and was saying to them in effect, Yes, men admire the ideal, but they will not enter into that Kingdom   in spite of their admiration, they are refusing to enter into it.   To admire the ideal is one thing. To accept it, submit to it, enter into its laws, is quite another.    He was preaching that very Kingdom of God.   That was the great burden of His preaching from the beginning of His ministry, as it had been of</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">His great predecessor, John the Baptist.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2595.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Take the story as a suggested revelation, bearing the Eastern atmosphere.    A certain man made a great supper.”   The nature of the Kingdom of God is that it is a gift, offered to man, an invitation to enter into the true order of life, as a gift.   Keep the simplicity of the story.  In the back of the mind of our Lord He thought of God as a Host, and He has provided, as a gift of His love and grace, the feast</p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">of the Kingdom.  It is a gift of grace.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2596.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2597.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">What is the right of entry    What right had anyone at the feast</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2598.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">None other than the invitation of the host.   The whole thing being of grace, no one had any right there, and gate-crashers in the supper are put out.  While the invitation constitutes a perfect right to the King- dom of God, yet at last the host says, None of those that were bidden shall eat of my supper. Why not    Because they refused. Their own refusal was the reason of their exclusion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2599.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2600.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Our Lord in a marvellous way gave illustrations of excuses, not reasons.

He has bought land, possessions, real estate.   We are bound to say that these people, on the level of human common-sense, were either liars or fools, every last one of them.

If we are excluded, it is because we refuse ourselves, and for no other reason  and if we refuse, why do we do so ?  Get behind the excuses, and whether it is the passion for wealth, or consecration to commerce, or mastery by human affection, there is something else behind that in every case.  The underlying reason of refusing to enter the Kingdom is hostility against God.  The carnal mind is enmity against God.  The carnal mind is the mind mastered by carnalities, by the flesh, by material things.  It is wonderful how much can be shut out with an apparently small thing.  A man can so put a golden sovereign before his eyes, as that he cannot see the sun or the world  and when men have put other things between themselves and God, the result is they become hostile to God, because they do not know Him, or understand Him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2617.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2618.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2619.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2620.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2621.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 24pt;text-align: left;">Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the Kingdom of God.”  Who is there who would not be prepared to say that.

It is important again that we briefly review the circumstances. The twenty-fifth verse reads,   There went with Him great multitudes.” Our Lord had left the house of the Pharisee where strange things had happened, and where He had found no congenial atmosphere. The hostility of the host was manifested in the presence there of the man with the dropsy,  The behaviour of the guests was at fault, and the principle of the hospitality of the host was wrong, as Jesus had shown. Then in answer to that exclamation of one of the guests, Jesus had spoken that parable of the great supper, the intention of which was to show the reluctance of the human heart.  Admiring the ideal, men were not prepared to submit to the conditions.  That all happened in the</span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">house.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2630.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2631.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2632.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">Having left the house, our Lord now used two parabolic illustrations. He had moved away, and started on His journeyings.  While He had been in that house, there were multitudes of people outside, who had been waiting for Him. These were the last months of our Lord’s public ministry, and by this time, wherever He went, the crowds went after Him, following Him from town to town, and village to village, eager, keen, interested, loving to hear Him, and to watch Him, and wanting to be near Him.  In many cases, perhaps the majority, they felt they would like to be connected with Him, enrolled as His followers. They were all waiting for Him, and   there went with Him great multitudes.”  The moment He came out of the house these waiting people outside were alert   and as He moved away, they went after Him.  That is the significance of the next phrase,  And He turned, and said unto them.”  Upon this occasion He declared the terms of disciple- ship.  It is almost like a fierce wind that blew across that crowd, un- questionably winnowing them. Yes, Jesus was winsome, but there was another aspect to His ministry, as well as winning. He was winnowing, and while He won those crowds, and they were interested, and were coming after Him, just as crowds do to-day, and are still doing, He turned round, and not this time only, superlatively, but constantly, He said things that blew like a wind of God across that crowd, thinning out those who wanted to be His followers.  He gave them the terms of discipleship.</p><p style="padding-left: 76pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">There is a phrase here from the lips of Jesus thrice repeated in</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2633.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2634.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2635.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2636.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2637.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2638.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">this paragraph.

I f any man were coming after Him, he could not do this unless he put loyalty to Him above the highest and finest and noblest loyalties of earthly love.  It was a tremendous saying. He said unless a man do that, he could not be His disciple.  Then to interpret what He meant by that saying, He declared,   Yea, and his own life also.”  Not only earthly loves, high, affectional loves, but the love of self, and the love of life.

This passage is only understood as we can see that crowd imaginatively. We need not travel to Palestine where He was at the time, nor need we go back nineteen hundred years to see it.  Take any massed company of men and women gathered together to-day, in an evangelistic service, interested in Jesus, attracted towards Him, and having a feeling that they would like, in some measure, to be associated with Him. Then let the preacher, as the mouthpiece of the Master, declare these terms of discipleship, and then look at that crowd.  They will be more attentive than ever for the moment  but if one is keen enough to discern the fact, there is a puzzled, almost restless look, and at last a protesting look, as though they would say, But surely those terms are severe  cannot it be made easier than that ?  Cannot we be His followers, and listen to Him and admire Him, and rejoice in His power without such drastic measures Humanity is just the same to-day as then.  Jesus would say to them to-day, without any reservation, what He said to them in the olden days.

What  next     And the gates of Hades shall not prevail against  it,“-battle.  The ultimate purpose of His presence was con- structive  but on the way to the completion of the work on which His heart was set, there were battles to be waged and won.  He had told His disciples that He would build. He had told them He would conduct the campaign victoriously, that the gates of Hades should not prevail against it.  Victory was in His mind.  The fulfilment of purpose was there.  He would build.  Now He used the same figures in a slightly different  application.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2690.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Thus He was telling them that the purpose of, and the reason of the severity was the greatness of His own emprise; and the fact that in order to complete that building and win that battle, He must have resources and men upon whom He could absolutely depend.  He was showing them that following Him meant more than personal advan- tage only.  Personal advantage was secondary, and in the presence of His Cross was smitten out of sight as almost unimportant.  Oh, the terror of it that we have so often made our salvation a kind of fire insurance, a way by which we may escape hell  Following Jesus meant far more than that, and this was what He was showing His dis- ciples. To follow Him was to commit oneself to His enterprises, to stand by Him in the battle, to stand with Him in the battle, until the building is done, and the battle is won.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2691.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2692.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">I will use an old illustration.  When Charles <span><img width="100" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2693.png"/></span> was exercising his marvellous ministry, and building up the Pastors’ College, he started a magazine, the title of which was <i>The Sword and the Trowel. </i>Nehemiah when building the wall of Jerusalem commanded the workers to grasp the sword as well as the trowel, to fight the enemies that would hinder the building.  <span><img width="52" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2694.gif"/></span> knew that little incident of ancient Hebrew history was symbolic of the action of God through the Jews, and of the mission of Jesus Christ.  Jesus came to build and He came for battle.  He had left the house of the Pharisee and found Himself surrounded by thronging multitudes interested in Him.  As He started to move away, they came with Him.  He turned, and halted them, and said in effect, What are you following Me for Are you coming after Me ?  I am in this world to build.  I am in this world to battle.  You are no good to Me unless you are of the right quality, the right calibre.  I do not want followers coming after Me</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 138pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE PARABLE OF LOST THINGS        <span><img width="18" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2695.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">for their own sake.

Quality is always the thing that counts in the Church of God, and among the disciples of Jesus, not quantity.   We have such an unholy passion for quantity.  We say, Great crowds go to that Church   it is a scene of success. Not at all. It may be that little chapel down in the valley,</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">or on the hillside, away in the Highlands, or in the   <span><img width="38" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2697.gif"/></span> of Wales where the  <span class="s72">two </span>and the three are gathered is of more use to God than the great congregation simply attracted by something less than the highest.

We do not now dwell upon the details of the parable, but rather attempt to gather its values, asking first, what it was our Lord intended to illustrate here    secondly, looking at the figures of which He made use   and finally gathering the teaching He intended</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">to give on this particular occasion.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2706.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">This is one parable, with three pictures.   Luke uses the expression at the beginning,   He spake unto them this parable.” There are stages in the pictures, but there is no break in the parable itself.    First,</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2707.gif"/></span>   <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2708.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2709.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">then, what was the subject that our Lord was intending to illustrate ? Reminding ourselves of the historic setting, this parable was uttered towards the close of that memorable Sabbath day, of which Luke alone gives so full an account.   Jesus had uttered His parable of the great supper, in the house of the Pharisee. He had used the two parabolic illustrations of building and battle, illustrating the reason for the severity of His terms of discipleship   and at the end of the previous chapter there fell from His Iips those words,    He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.”   Going straight on with the narrative, Luke says,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2710.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: justify;">Now all the publicans and sinners were drawing near unto Him for to hear Him.”  He had uttered severe terms, interpreted in the figures of building and battle, showing that He needed those with Him who</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2711.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2712.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2713.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">should stand by Him in His building until the work was done    and in the war till the victory was won   and the publicans and sinners pressed closer to Him   they drew near to hear Him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2714.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2715.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But they were not alone in the crowd.    The Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.”  He let them come near Him.   He did not stand aloof.  Indeed, He went so far as to sit down and eat with them.    The scribes were the appointed moral teachers and interpreters of the law    and the Pharisees were the great ritualists and supernaturalists in the realm</p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of religion.  Both these criticized Him.   The crowds, held in contempt by the rulers, were getting near Him, and He was receiving them.</p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The Pharisees and scribes were standing aloof, critical, uttering words of condemnation.  We discover then, unquestionably, the subject which our Lord wished to illustrate.   He was first declaring the meaning and reason of His receiving sinners.   That is what the Pharisees and scribes objected to.  He received them, and the word is a very strong one. He received them to Himself.   He took them into close comradeship, and sat down, and had close fellowship with them, and He ate with them. He was trying to show these critical rulers why He received sinners and ate with them.  He was interpreting to them the actions they were criticizing. It is quite evident that the subject He wished to illus-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2716.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">trate was not the manner of His own ministry and method    but rather the attitudes and activities of God in the presence of derelict humanity.</p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When we remember these things, then we are prepared to follow Him, listen to His words, look at the pictures, and gather the teaching.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="1" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2717.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2718.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">There are here four pictures   three, and one more.  Jesus first drew the picture of a shepherd and his lost sheep.   He began by appealing to them, as was so constantly His custom.    What <i>man </i>of you.”  He told the story of a shepherd who had a hundred sheep, one of which,</p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">no reason being given, had wandered and was lost.   He declared that any true shepherd, if he had lost one sheep, would leave the ninety and nine, and go into the wilderness, and find it.   It was not the first time He had employed the figure of the shepherd.   That, however, is the first phase of this parable.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 140pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE PARABLE OF LOST THINGS       <span><img width="18" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2719.gif"/></span><span class="s33">   ,</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="42" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2720.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2721.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="42" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2722.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: left;">Then next, a woman and her lost drachma, her piece of silver. As a picture there may be differing opinions as to its intention.  One view is that this woman had lost <span class="s72">a </span>piece of current coin in the house She had ten, and had lost one.  The story would lose nothing if that were its meaning.  I think, however, that there <span class="s72">is </span>something deeper in it.  The women of that time often wore upon their brow a      that was called <span><img width="39" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2723.gif"/></span>  It was made up of coins, in themselves perhaps largely valueless, each one of which might be worth <span><img width="33" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2724.gif"/></span> or per- haps a little more  but under a shilling.  But it was a coin that had stamped upon it the image of authority.  Again here scholars differ as to the significance of the frontlet.  Some hold that it was a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2725.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2726.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">that revealed betrothal  and again others, that it revealed the marriage relationship.  Whether it was of little monetary value or not, it was of priceless value to the woman who wore it.  That is evidenced by the fact that she sought it diligently, sweeping the house, until she found it. I cannot imagine a woman sweeping a long time to find a shilling But I can imagine her searching diligently to find something which, to her, was a thing of beauty, and adornment, and suggestiveness. However, that is the picture.  One coin out of ten, gone.  The woman had lost that which perfected the symbolism of her frontlet.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2727.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2728.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The third picture is familiar and beautiful, that of the father who lost his boy.  But there is another.  It is the final phase in this parabolic setting forth of Jesus.  It is the picture of an unnatural son, who was upright and loyal by all the outward appearances of life, but who had no understanding of, or sympathy with, his father’s heart  and con- sequently held his brother in contempt. Undoubtedly there were such, as there always are.  There is the merging of four figures.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2729.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">What does it all mean   What did our Lord intend to teach</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2730.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">First of all, as we listen to Him telling those stories, keeping in mind that crowd of men about Him, and that crowd of <span><img width="53" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2731.gif"/></span> and sinners pressing eagerly forward, conscious of their own failure and sin, yet eager to hear Him in spite of the severity of the terms He had uttered as we listen to Him we gather what His outlook was upon humanity. He saw humanity lost.  Whether it was the sheep, or the drachma, or the son, in His view each was lost.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2732.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Take the first three phases.  What an illustration is there of lost humanity. First, a lost sheep. A sheep is one of the most stupid things. It goes anywhere where it sees a gap. It does not stop to think.  It cannot think.  A gap appears in a fence, and the animal goes through it, and away it goes, wandering on, until it is lost upon the mountains, and does not know its way back.  There are multitudes of people who exactly fit in with that description  lost from sheer stupidity.</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">How was the piece of silver lost ?  It was not to blame at all for being lost.  There was something lost through the carelessness of others. Mark it well, lost at home, but lost.

They are lost through the carelessness of others.</p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">When we  <span class="p">turn to the picture of the first son, we have a very</span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">different story.

Humanity away from God is expending the forces which God has created in them, and committed to them.   Every man who sins with his hand, foot, eye, or mind, is sinning with force that God has given to him to bless him, and to make him.

He gave him the lowest and most degrading and humiliating thing to do.    And  he would fain have been filled with the husks that the swine did eat    and no man gave unto him.”   I never read that sentence without thinking all the nobility was not gone from him even then.    I know men who, if no man gave to them, they would have helped themselves.    He did not. He suffered hunger.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2746.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">But  he came to himself.”  It is a great hour when a man comes to himself, when substance is gone, and friends are gone, and the possibility of finding food is gone.   There is nothing left.   He came to himself, and that is when reason dawned again.    He began to think. He was lost. That is Christ’s outlook.

The emphasis lies in agony upon the heart of the one who has lost. The shepherd is suffering more than the wandering sheep. The woman is suffering because the silver is lost. It is the father who knows the depth of agony when that boy is away.</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It is the father who knows the pain of having a son who does not understand. Lost, the possession gone, the purchasing power of the coin, or its significance from the standpoint of order and beauty, gone. Love deeply wounded by the wanderer, and the hide-bound vanity of self-pity.</p><p style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">If that is the Lord’s outlook upon humanity, what is His relation</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2752.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of God   All the stories merge and blend.

While he was yet afar off, his father saw him    and ran.”  Is there any lack of dignity to see an old man running    Do not believe it.

I declare that there is no dignity greater than the running</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">of a father to meet his boy.

The phrase is enough.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2758.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">None of the ransomed ever knew How deep <span class="s57">were the waters  </span>crossed.</p><p style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 83%;text-align: left;">Nor how dark was the night that the Lord passed through, E’er He found the sheep that was lost.”</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That is God. The search within the dwelling is God seeking by His Spirit. The woman is the instrument, but the inspiration is Divine. Then we see the picture of God in the father, welcoming the boy.

Judged by the days in which we live, he expected to have fine clothes, and jewellery. When he got back home, the father called for the best robe, a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.  He got these when he came home. He lost them in the far country.  He expected food, and variety of menu, and he came to an hour when nobody would give him husks. But when he got home, they killed the fatted calf.  He went to the far country to be free from restraint, and he found disillusionment. When he came back he found merriment, gladness, restoration.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2760.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Then we come to that other man in the field.  How we have tried to explain him. What varied explanations have been given. There is no explanation that is final.  It has been said that he represented the Jew, and the other son the Gentile. To me that is far-fetched.  I am sure He intended an illustration of the men criticizing Him, the scribes and  Pharisees.  But whatever we have said about the elder son, the father did not say anything unkind to him.   Son, thou art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine.”  He went out and entreated him to come in. ‘He was as concerned about that son as about the one who had been away.  All he said to him was in the nature of a tender and gentle appeal.  That was the revelation of God that He gave to those who were listening.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2761.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Then look at them again, Pharisees and scribes. What did all that mean, or what did He intend it should mean for them   I have no means of knowing if any understood Him.  Any interpretation of religion which holds derelict humanity in contempt is the worst form of irreligion.  To hold in contempt the unwashed multitudes outside is the most irreligious thing of which a man can be guilty. Such attitude demonstrates ignorance of God, and consequently failure to appreciate the true value of humanity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2762.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2763.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2764.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">What about those publicans and sinners, and those listening crowds.

That is found in the opening verse of the chapter,  And He said also unto the disciples.”  He had spoken the parable of the lost things specially to the criticizing scribes and Pharisees, but also to the listening crowd of publicans and sinners.

We read,  And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things.”  They were  listening,   and they scoffed at Him.” He spoke then to His disciples immediately after He had uttered the threefold parable, in answer to the criticism of His attitude towards sinners by the Pharisees and scribes.  Why did they scoff at Him after they heard this parable of the unjust steward-and His application of it   We are told the reason,  They were lovers of money.”  That lay behind all this criticism of Jesus on the part of all these rulers   lovers of money.” Not money, but the love of it.  The Bible never says money is the root of evil, but the love of it.   The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil,” is a very profound saying. He was talking in the hearing of these men, to the disciples especially, but to these men also who were lovers of money.  That was the motive behind everything, the motive of their criticism of Him, and of their aloofness from the unwashed multitudes and sinning crowd. They were   lovers of money.”  He talked about money, and began with a story.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2784.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2785.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">We see therefore that the subject illustrated was that of motive, the method in the use of mammon, that is, of material possessions. Our Lord had much in His teaching of the larger life, and the world beyond this, and spiritual verities  but here He was dealing literally with the subject of money  talking to His disciples, but in the presence of men whose master passion was money, wealth, possessions.

I will defraud him a little more to my own advantage, in order that the people who will reap the benefit, will take me in, when the lord, my master, has cast me out.   So he proceeded,   How much owest thou unto my lord ?  A hundred measures of oil. Take thy bond</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2802.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2803.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2804.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">and write fifty.”    How much owest thou   A hundred measures of wheat.

Probably he knew the situation of those people, that some were better off than others.   It was extremely clever. His lord commended him for his wisdom, rather, for his prudence, his smartness.   Cleverness practised, and admired   There is no record that the lord reinstated him.   He simply looked at what he had done. He was clever.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2805.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2806.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">But Jesus told us why he commended him.

They saw nothing before their birth, and they did not see that very clearly, but they knew it was a fact  and they saw nothing beyond the end, and they were not very much concerned about that.  They were living in the age, in their generation.  That was the limitation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2811.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2812.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2813.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="14" height="18" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2814.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2815.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2816.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2817.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: left;">The sons of light are those who see far more than that.  They see far more than the near.  Peter, when describing certain people, wrote in one of his letters,  seeing only what is near.”  What a condemnation that is.  I commend to thought the word of the Old Testament,  The eyes of the fool are in the ends of the earth.”  People say it means that a fool is a man who, instead of attending to things near him, is engaged in things in the ends of the earth. That is not what it means.  He is a fool because he sees nothing beyond the ends of the earth.  He is bounded by the material.  He is acting as though the earth were all, and the generation everything, and the age in which he is living is the only thing that matters. The sons of light see beyond. They see the earth, they see the near  but they walk   the light.  The Light is now shining upon men, the One Who said,  I am the light of the world he that followeth Me shall not walk in the darkness.”  They see the near, but they always see more.  They put upon to-day the measure- ments of eternity, upon the dust the values of Deity, upon the age the measurement of undying ages, upon the generation,  the generation of the age of the ages.”  Sons of light   It is a descriptive phrase.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2818.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">If that contrast is seen, what was our Lord doing ?  While He had in mind those critical Pharisees who were lovers of money, He also saw the group of disciples round about Him, and His words constituted a rebuke.  He was rebuking them because of their absence of acumen in the highest things. Look at this rogue. See the cleverness with which he manipulated things. But said Jesus-and He spoke with infinite knowledge and understanding-on the earth level, within the boundaries of the age and the generation, they are so bounded  but they are more astute, more filled with acumen than the sons of light, who are supposed to be living with the measurements of eternity placed upon all the things of time.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">We cannot finish there, because all He said in immediate connec- tion has its bearing.

In other words, the mammon of unrighteousness is neither moral nor immoral  it is non- moral.  Mammon, or money, is an instrument, an agent for good or for evil.  Everything depends on how it is used, and how we use it depends upon how we think in our deepest life.  Nothing reveals the thinking of a man more clearly than the use he makes of money.  Our Lord had one thing to say.  Make friends to yourself by means of it.  That is an alteration from the Authorized rendering.  He never told men to make friends of mammon, but to make friends by means of it.  So use money as to make friends. Friends  Yes. A man may say, I have got some money, but I want it for myself. Is he using it for himself alone   Christ said, Do not use it that way. Make friends by means of it.  So use wealth as to gather friends.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2830.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="26" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2831.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2832.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2833.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2834.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2835.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2836.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2837.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2838.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: right;">Then mark how He swept out beyond the age and the generation.

Make friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, for it shall fail. It always does. We can use it, and it is still there, but we have used it, whether we have got it, or someone else.

It is the only case in all the parables where He used a name.    It may be this was a statement of an actual case, which He had seen, and which perhaps those listening to Him, had seen.   I do not dogmatize, but that position applies equally to the story of the unrighteous steward, which</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2861.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 107pt;text-indent: -7pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">we have considered.

But if these were actual cases known to Jesus, that He used them parabolically there can be no doubt whatever.    We shall there- fore consider this story as parabolic, whether from actual life, or an imaginary picture, as so often, does not really matter.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2862.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">What was the subject then He was intending to illustrate     Con- sider quite simply the figure He employed, and from those two things attempt to deduce the special teaching.</p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">In reading this story there are two perils we must avoid.    We have no right to leave anything out of the story that is in it.    Secondly we have no right to read into it anything which is not found therein.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2863.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2864.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">These two principles are vital.   Some have been dogmatic on the ques- tion of duration, which may be suggested.   There is nothing here to warrant any such position.   Going as far as our Lord has gone, we consider first the story only, and we ask, What subject was it Jesus was intending to illustrate    He never told a story without a purpose, and that purpose is always discoverable in the context.    Looking back at the fourteenth verse we read that    the Pharisees who were lovers of money, heard all these things.” What things ? The teaching He had been definitely and specially giving to His disciples, which found</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2865.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">its culmination in His command,   Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness,” and when it (the mammon)   <span><img width="25" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2866.gif"/></span><span class="s33"> </span>they (the friends made) shall receive you into the eternal habitations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2867.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2868.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He had uttered that culminating dictum,    Ye cannot serve God and mammon,” and when the Pharisees heard these things, because they were lovers of money, they laughed at Him,    they scoffed Him.”  The Greek word is a strong one.   It means not merely that they smiled, but with ribald mockery they laughed at Him, mocked Him, at the idea of the relation between material and spiritual wealth.     That led to this story, though not immediately, for in the verses preceding the nineteenth, we find that He unmasked their motive and their method, unmasking the reason why they laughed at His interpretation of the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2869.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 129pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE RICH MAN AND LAZARUS</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2870.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">relative values between material wealth and spiritual, between mammon and the fear of God  and the reason was as He said, that they lived in the sight of men, instead of in the sight of God.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Then continuing, He showed how they were unfaithful in much, in great things, and consequently they were not to be trusted in the very little.  Again there is the contrast between the spiritual and the material, between the eternal and the temporal, between the much of life in its vastness and all the ages, and the very little of life conditioned</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2871.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2872.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in dust, on the material level.   He told them men unfaithful in the much were unfaithful in the little, and the relation of the much to the very little, of the spiritual to the material, is the relation of time to eternity  and so the relation of money and its possession to the life that lies beyond. That was the occasion of the story. In connection with those solemn and revealing words, He said,    There was a certain rich man.”</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 10pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">In this story we find the one occasion when our Lord stretched out His hand, and drew aside the veil that hangs between the now and the hereafter, and allowed men to look and see not merely what lay beyond, but the intimate relationship between the now and the then, between the here and the hereafter.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Take the story quite simply.   Jesus drew a contrast between two men living on earth, on two entirely different levels. The one was wealthy, living in luxury and ostentation.    It is significant that there is not a thing against this rich man, measuring him by the standards</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">of time.  We are not told that he was vulgar, though he was terribly</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2873.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2874.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">so, as every man is who is living only on the level of the dust.    No court of law in England would have put this man on trial.    The things we usually classify as vulgar sins are not in sight.    There is no sugges- tion that he was living a depraved life, but he was rich.    That was not wrong.  He was clothed in purple. and fine linen. Those are small expressions, but in the East that meant the elements and things mani- festing his riches. They spoke of abounding wealth. Even when it is said that the beggar was laid at his gate, the word used is   <span><img width="33" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2875.gif"/></span> which means a gate full of artistry and exquisite beauty.    He lived there in wealth and luxury. The revealing word of course is this,    faring sumptuously every day.” A marginal note says,    Living in mirth and splendour every day.”   There is only one word that conveys that in English, flamboyantly. What does that mean ? Living ostenta-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="65" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2876.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">tiously, in abounding wealth, dressed in purple and fine linen. We are told that a robe of fine linen was worth six times its weight in gold. These simple         are intended to show a man on the earth level, lacking nothing, enjoying everything, and especially enjoying</p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">the fact that he possessed, and could show it in ostentatious   <span><img width="44" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2877.gif"/></span><span class="s87"> </span>flamboyant living.  We are told that the beggar lay at his beautiful gate, and would fain be filled with the crumbs that fell from his table.</p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Possibly he was, but certainly the rich man knew nothing about it,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="20" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2878.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 103pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">or if he did and suffered it, there was no credit to him.

There is no more poignant picture of abject poverty than that man, living in hunger, evidently lacking the necessities of life, and the nourishment of the body, so that he was full</p><p style="padding-left: 102pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of sores.  We are not told how he came to be there.   There is no dealing with social conditions.  They were there, or that man had never been in that position. There is no blame attached to circumstances and</p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: left;">environment, and none is suggested as attaching to the man. As a matter of fact, the issue, when he crossed over, proves he was a godly man, that he believed in the God of Abraham. Poor, weak, so far down, that the rough pariah dogs had pity on him, and with healing salve, licked his sores.   There is no contrast more remarkable than that of two men on the earth level.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2881.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2882.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2883.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">But our Lord had not finished His story, and those two men had not finished. Something came to them both. What was it     The beggar died.”    The rich man also died.”   They both died  and all the ostentatious splendour of the rich man could not buy off the rider</p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">on the pale horse, when he approached his beautiful gate.    He died. And the beggar could not escape, had he so desired to do, the lot that was common. He died. That is how it ends for all, you Pharisees,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2884.gif"/></span></p><p class="s42" style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;"><span><img width="52" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2885.gif"/></span> <span class="s43">and sinners, Christ might have said.

A beggar of that type, completely destitute, alone, covered with sores,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2889.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">at last breathing out his spirit in all his poverty, in those times was not buried.  Almost inevitably the cleaners passed the dead body, unknown, unclean, and hurried him away in the early dawn until they came to Tophet, Gehenna, the rubbish and refuse heap of fire, where they flung the body in.  That is a known fact of the time, and the very fact we are not told he was buried, leads us to suppose such an end for him.  The rich man was buried, on the earth level, and one wonders how much the funeral cost   I have no doubt it harmonized with the kind of life he had lived.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="9" height="18" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2890.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2891.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Is that all   No, that is not all. What about the beggar    In Hades he was   comforted.”  Our Lord used a Jewish figure of speech, Hades, the place of departed spirits.   The rich man was in Hades.   So was the beggar. They were both there in Hades. That is not Hell,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2892.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">the place of torment.   The rich man was in Hades, in torment, and the beggar was in Hades and was comforted   one great realm that of the departed spirits, clearly divided as Jewish theology taught, and we believe.  On one side, to use a geographical expression, the spirits of the evil, the spirits of the lawless, of the rebellious, those who have forgotten and rebelled against God. On the other side, the souls</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2893.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 140pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">THE RICH MAN AND LAZARUS</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2894.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: left;">under the altar, a Hebrew figure of speech used in the Apocalypse souls in Abraham’s bosom, the souls of the righteous, who on the earth level trusted in God, and were obedient to God, and walked in the ways of Jehovah.

That is a great word,  <span><img width="56" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2896.gif"/></span>  He was called near. The rich man was tormented, that is, in anguish, and the root of the word means the uttermost dejection, sinking.    The one man was called near to Abraham‘s bosom, and to the God Who he had served. The other man buried and banished, sinking with. the treatment    the torture resulting from his neglect of God.   That is the picture.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2897.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">What has this story to say to us    Take the simple plain facts. By that picture and that story our Lord insisted upon the fact first of existence beyond the article which men call death.    Dying is the end of earthly and conscious opportunities and activities. Beyond that, however, personality and consciousness continue, whether it is that of the rich man, or the beggar. Crossing over the boundary line that</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">we speak of as death, they are not extinct, and they are conscious. That is the first tremendous truth that is taught by the story.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">The next is that the conditions beyond, result from life as it is lived on the earth level.   The one had left behind him the things in which he gloried and boasted and had paraded.    All the flamboyant living was over.  It was left, the purple and the fine linen, to the moths, and the wealth to quarrelling relatives, if we are to believe humanity</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">is the same, and it is. He went out into eternity a pauper, and a pauper stripped.   The little  <span class="s35">left, he lost the much that was never </span>possessed.  It was too late to gain possession.   The other man crossing over was drawn near to the much, near to the spiritual, near to the eternal, near to the heart of the God of law, Who is the God of love, drawn near to reality, drawn near to God.   The condition beyond was the result of the method of life here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2898.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2899.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="20" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2900.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">One more thing, and perhaps the most arresting of all,    We have the conversation as Jesus described it, between this rich man and Abraham.  We hear that haunting cry, as the rich man said concerning his brethren,   If one go to them from the dead, they will repent.” Then this startling and amazing answer of Abraham as recorded by our Lord,   If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither     they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2901.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2902.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">In other words, Life is never affected by the miracles, if it is not affected by the moral.

Finally Jesus Himself was raised</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">202   <span class="p">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2904.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">from the dead.

They put Him to death, and when He was raised from the dead, they became busy trying to put to death all those who followed Him.   A tremendous truth this.

The answer cannot be studied without seeing that our Lord was recognizing the reason for the weakness of which these men were conscious.   He knew, He always knows, and always deals, not with our request upon the surface, but with what lies behind it.    That is what He was doing here.   They did not need their faith increased they were not needing quantity, but quality.    If they had faith as a grain of mustard seed.   He detected that, lying behind their request for an increase of faith which should enable them to fulfil the severity and sternness of His demands, was a hope that if they could gain this power, some increase of faith, there would be some reward following</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">it, there would be some virtue in it, some benefit, following such an</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">attainment that would come to them.   This He knew, so His reply in parabolic illustration and parable  <span class="s89">was </span>based upon a recognition of the reasons for their weakness, and these were the subjects that He illus- trated. Faulty faith results from wrong motives. True faith issues in right motives.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2924.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2925.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Take the two figures.  First, a grain of mustard seed.   In the para- bolic discourses of Jesus in Matthew xiii., He used the same figure in another application, and with another purpose.    He then said of the grain of mustard seed,   which indeed is less than all seeds.”   He now took this very little thing, and said to these men their faith should be like it. What is the principle involved in that ?   What is there in a grain of mustard  <span class="s41">seed   In the previous parable He had said the seed, </span>least of all the seeds, grew.  There we are face to face with the principle, which is that of life.   He was insisting upon the life principle in the grain of mustard seed, and because of that, in its development, it will produce results.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">There was an interesting picture in a recent paper of a curious growth, of an enormous piece of statuary split in two, because a seed had been dropped there, and as it developed and grew, its roots going downward, gathered force, and it had split the masonry, and finally</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2926.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the statue. No application was made of it.    It was simply a curious picture.   However it is interesting, in the light of an old story of a granite tomb in Italy, where a man was buried many years ago, who was flippant in his agnosticism to faith and to Christianity especially. He had given instructions that a slab of granite weighing many tons should be placed over the place of his burial, so that there should be no chance of his body ever coming up, if there was any resurrection</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2927.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They placed his body in the grave, and placed the granite slab upon it.

It is an Eastern picture in its terminology.  The word used for servant is <span><img width="37" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2937.gif"/></span> slave. Slaves are doing their work in the fields, and at the close of the day they still have duty to perform, as they come in from their ploughing, or watching over the flocks. Jesus said, What happens  Does the owner of the fields, flocks, ploughs, and slaves, invite these men to sit down and have their evening meal ?  Does he not rather tell them to carry on and do their evening work, and prepare his meal  and when he has eaten, they can take their places at the board   Such the simple picture as He drew it, so well understood by those standing around Him. He asked them this question, Do you say, Thank you  Are we halted as we read that ?  Are we inclined to say, Of course we say, Thank you   We do, and very often too, but we never need do so. There is nothing in inherent justice that demands that we should thank anyone for service, which is merely the rendering of an obligation, and the doing of a duty.  We do say, Thank you  but there is no inherent necessity.  At this point Jesus was using the figure that slaves do not sit down first to eat, but only when they have done their duty.  The master does not thank them for what they have done. There is no need that he should.  If we want to be thanked for doing our duty, that shows our hearts were not in the duty.</p><p style="padding-left: 105pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">How curious to bring those illustrations together, and yet how</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2938.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">close together they are.  What is the teaching   Take the first illustra- tion of the grain of mustard seed.  Men facing the demands of Jesus, feeling how tremendous they are, intelligently feeling it, conscious of their own weakness, in all sincerity said to Jesus, Increase our faith. The plea is not over.  People are still praying for an increase of faith. It reveals a false thinking on a true line, an outlook that is conscious of weakness, and has grasped the value of faith, and asks for an increase. Our Lord said, You do not need more faith, but faith of a different kind and nature.  It is not a question of quantity, but one of quality.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2939.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Then what is faith   Faith is that which has in it a principle of life. We may define a living faith by saying three things about it. Living faith is, first, conviction concerning the fact of God. It is, secondly, the experience of relationship with God.  Thirdly and con- sequently, living faith is absolute submission to the will of God.  Faith in God is far more than conviction that He exists.  Thousands of people believe in the existence of God, but they have no living faith, no faith like a grain of mustard seed, with the principle of life and force at its very heart.  There must be conviction of God, but there must also be</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2940.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">THE UNPROFITABLE SERVANTS</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2941.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">relationship with Him, the going out of the soul towards Him in faith. That means-and here is the point of supreme emphasis-submission to Him. Jesus said to those men, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you would say to that sycamine tree, Be rooted up, and be planted in the sea, and it should be done.  There is no doubt that where He said this, there was a sycamine <i>tree growing, </i>and He pointed it out.  There was another occasion when He used, not the sycamine tree, but something far bigger and bulkier-a mountain.  It is the same thing, whether the tree planted in the soil near to them, or the mountain towering its head above Galilee.  He said if we had faith as a grain of mustard seed, we would say to the tree, Be rooted up and planted in the sea  or we would say to a mountain, Be removed and be buried in the sea.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2942.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2943.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2944.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">We ask, But is that so ? Yes, if we have faith with the life principle in it.  I am emphasizing a truth that is fundamental  first, conviction of God  secondly, relationship with God  and then obedience to God. We cannot exercise faith in God in doing anything that we do not know to be the will of God.  We shall never say to a sycamine tree, Be rooted up and be planted in the sea, unless we know God wants that sycamine tree rooted up and planted there.  We shall never say to a mountain, Be removed, and go into the sea, except we know it is God’s will that that mountain should be removed and cast into the sea.</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">That is where we break down in faith, and that is why we are still asking for an increase of faith, thinking if we had more, we should be better able to meet its demands.  But no, it is a life principle, and that is belief in God, having relationship with Him, being submitted to <span class="s41">Him.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2945.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_2946.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">Let us test our praying by that.  We say, We have prayed, and we have believed in God, and we have relationship with Him  and we wanted this great mountain, barring our way, removed.  We want it moved, but we do not seem to have faith.  Does God want it moved Is it His will that the sycamine tree should be rooted up from the place where it is growing and flourishing, and perish in the waters of the sea ? That is the supreme question. These men wanted more faith.

Christ</p><p style="padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">had said that of him at the beginning. Here he said it himself. He said within himself, he was not going to be compelled to do anything, because he did not fear God, nor care anything about this woman.

He intended to teach exactly the opposite. That may be challenged by those who quote and love the idea of knocking and knocking, and asking and asking, and praying,   That may have its value, but that is not what our Lord was teaching here, but exactly the opposite.

All that God is, the judge was not.   The judge had no sense of high sanc- tions.  Life is always on a low level when self is the inspiration.    Self is always animal and beastly when lived alone.    No, he had no care for God  no care for man.   He had no sense of God, and made no response to high sanctions.

Mark the judge  indifferent delay for a while  but when he acted, his action was in order to escape personal suffering and annoyance.  Now look at God, and mark the declaration that the Lord made here about Him.  God shall do justice to His own elect, which cry to Him day and night.  That does not mean a perpetual wailing on the part of man, but it means the continuity of necessity through the ages.  He is long-suffering over them, and He will avenge them speedily. The judge delayed, was indifferent, and did not give at all until he was forced by the necessity created by his own desire not to be worried.  If we go to God, He will act, and act speedily, Behind that we have a revelation of God. That revelation is made in Old and New Testaments, and specially in Christ Himself that God’s action is at cost to Himself to secure justice for those who need it. The man’s action was to escape annoyance. God’s action is motivated by His willingness to suffer all things for humanity, for</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3034.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">God was in Christ, reconciling.”</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">So Christ is saying, We ought always to pray, and when we pray, there is no need for us to keep on as though God were unwilling to listen.

It is the return to the subject of the coming of the Son of man.  He had told them when He comes, things will be going on as they had been, that He would break in <i>on all </i>the godlessness, when He comes in  judgment.  Now He reverted to it.   Howbeit when the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith on the earth   It does not mean that He will not find faith, but He will not find the faith established, victorious.  That is in harmony with the teaching that this age is not to be consummated with a perfect victory of faith upon all the earth but it will be broken in upon by the advent of the Son of man  and until then, men ought always to pray, and not to faint  and they can do that because God is what He is.</p><p class="s76" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">212   <span class="p">PARARLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="62" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3048.gif"/></span></p><ol id="l13"><li data-list-text="43."><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 172pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">The Pharisee and the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3049.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Luke xviii  <span class="s80">g-14</span></p><p class="s91" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 25pt;text-align: left;">T</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 118pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">HIS <span class="s9">is one of the best known and best loved parables of Jesus.

It was</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3053.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">spoken to a certain personal and relative attitude.

That attitude is seen again and again in the Gospels.    Once some of these men addressed the crowd, and spoke of them as cursed, those who did not know the law.

Here we are in the presence of familiar things.  Jesus drew a picture of two men in the temple.    Two men went up into the Temple to pray.”   They both went to the temple, and they both went to pray.  At that point this story becomes searching.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3070.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3071.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3072.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3073.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3074.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Isaiah had referred to the Temple, and had called it    My holy moun- tain,”  My house of prayer    and in the course of His ministry Jesus referred to it by practically citing Isaiah’s words,    It is written, And My house shall be called a house of prayer.”   So two men are here, seen going to the right place, the place appointed, the house of prayer, with all that that word meant.    Look at the two men, and see the similarity between them.

That idea was familiar then in their current life.    Archelaus,      the Great, and Antipas, each in turn had gone to Rome to receive a king- dom. They were tetrarchs.

He is reigning now, and the time of His coronation was at His ascension.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3203.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But He wanted these disciples to see that what they were looking for, which they did not understand, was that the visible and outward victory was postponed  that He was going away to receive a Kingdom.

Here is the heart and centre of our parable.   When the king was gone, he gave to his servants   ten of them being named. That is a symbolic reference, and covers the whole ground.   He gave ten pounds to ten servants, a pound to each. This parable of the pounds must not be confused with the parable of the talents, recorded</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3205.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3206.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3207.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3208.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3209.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">by Matthew.  The significance of the talents was the varying gifts that may be bestowed. Here in this parable it is equal opportunity. The pound is a deposit, intended to be used in the interest of the passing hour.  They were to trade with it.   The word used is a beautiful one occupy, in the sense of trading.   The business of those left behind was that they were to take the common deposit, and use it in the interest of the business of the King.   They were responsible to trade with His pound   his servants, and his business. Paul in the Ephesian letter urged those to whom he wrote that they    redeem the time, because the days are evil.”   The marginal reading for   redeeming the time is a word that marks the activity of the merchants and the market</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3210.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 81pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">place,  buying up the opportunity.”   This is not the usual word for redeeming, or for time.  The meaning is the opportunity.   Our business then, according to Paul, is to buy up the opportunity, to prosecute the commerce of the Kingdom of God with such diligence as characterizes the success of the merchant-men in the market places of the world.</p><p style="padding-left: 81pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">That is the idea.</p><p style="padding-left: 81pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">There is no Christian man or woman without that pound.    We may say we have not ten talents, but that is another   matter.  The pound is something other than the gift.   The pound is a deposit, and is the Gospel of the grace of God. We are witnesses to that Gospel. Our business in this world, whether men arc saying still, We will not have</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 188pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE POUNDS             <span><img width="23" height="20" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3211.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="16" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3212.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">this Man to reign over us, is to do business with that deposit      to make use of it that gains other.

One is full and complete.  <span class="s64">One </span>man at the reckoning said,    Thy pound hath made ten pounds more.”   Notice he did not say, I have been very successful and persistent, and managed to make thy pound into ten.</p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The pound did it itself.  But he had simply fulfilled the responsibility of trading with it, and there were ten.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3214.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Another man had not so full, but a partial result-five.    Then that other man who had the deposit, did not use it, but took care of it, wrapped it up in a napkin, did not trade with it    and the reason he gave was that he knew his lord was stern, and that he reaped where</p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">he did not sow.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3215.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The citizens outside that group of servants were in revolt.

That is what the world is still saying. It is still saying it in its governments, and especially in those which have in past history acknowledged our Christ, where He has been known and pre-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3216.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">sented, and is now dismissed.

About that there is no question. When He comes again He will come as King   not to be made King.   Then the Kingdom of God will appear according to this parable.    The first activity of His reappearing will be the investigation of what His servants have done with His pound.   Where there has been full fidelity there will be fuller responsibility   ten cities to be ruled over.   Where there has been partial success, still increased responsibility    five cities. But what about this man who refused to trade ?   On his own confession our Lord said He would judge him out of his own words, and He quoted them, not to affirm the truth of it, but to show what he thought himself.  It was an entirely wrong conception of his lord, and based upon that wrong conception he had hidden His pound and wrapped</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="1" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3220.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3221.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">it in a napkin, and taken care of it.   Our Lord asked him why he had not put it in the bank, so that He could have had it with interest    a question saturated with satire. What happened to him    Nothing, except that he lost his pound.   It was taken from him, and given to the man most successful. He was deprived of that opportunity. He had missed it.  He did not buy it up, and now his own action was unavailing.</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">I do not think it suggests he was cast out himself.   He was saved, so as by fire, and there one leaves him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3222.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3223.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">As to the citizens who had been in open revolt   when He estab- lishes the Kingdom they must be slain and swept out.

He took as his text the words,   As He went,” and he gathered up in a remarkable way the occasions when that, or a similar</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3257.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">phrase, occurred in the story of Jesus.

Perhaps a state- ment like that needs qualification.   All the elements of human nature were present in this man’s personality in a remarkable degree.    Andrew was perhaps a representative man. John was not.    He was a mystic, a dreamer, a poet ; a man looking for things not seen, and seeing them listening, for things not heard, and hearing them    feeling after the intangible, and touching then. Philip was a quiet and unimpressive man, always willing to be on the edge of the crowd, and showing others</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3264.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">in but this man Simon was just a human.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3265.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3266.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3267.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">When he came to Jesus, He said to him    Thou shalt be called Rock.”  What was the value of that   What was the subject our Lord was illustrating    Without any hesitation I say that He was</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3268.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 132pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3269.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">illustrating there and then prophetically, for the sake of those listening, for Philip and <span><img width="61" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3270.gif"/></span> for Andrew and John, and Andrew’s brother, the possibility of human nature under His Messiahship. Simon had come at his brother’s invitation to see the Messiah.  After his interview with Jesus, Andrew had found his brother Peter, and has hastened to find him, to tell him one thing only, that was on Andrew’s heart, the thing that obsessed his mind and had already constrained his will</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3271.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 104pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">We have found the Messiah.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3272.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3273.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3274.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: justify;">It is a little difficult for us to grasp the meaning of that.  We are so familiar with the word Christ, which is only the Greek form of Messiah, meaning Anointed.  We associate it quite properly with our Lord.  But if we put ourselves back into the place of Andrew and Simon, and remember that for hundreds of years the one great hope, sometimes flaming and glowing, and sometimes dying into a faint ember, was the coming of the Messiah.  They were all looking for Him. Andrew hurried to find Simon to tell him the amazing thing that he had found the Messiah.  I think Andrew’s feet were hurried by the greatness of the discovery that had come to him. One old Puritan expositor has said there is no doubt that Andrew hurried after Simon, because Simon had been such a nuisance in the family, and he thought it might help him to get him to Jesus early    prefer, however, to believe, in spite of the nuisance Simon may have been, Andrew saw the dynamic in that brother of his.  While the forces were scattered there were great possibilities in him. That can be dismissed as imagination   but there is no doubt this human was an awkward customer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3275.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3276.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Jesus knew the conviction that had come to Andrew that He was the Messiah in that private interview in the house, and He knew that this brother had hastened in obedience to his brother’s invitation, to see Him. So He stood in front of him, the Messiah, and to that man He said   Thou shalt be rock,”   Thou shalt be called Rock.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3277.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3278.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3279.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">That brings us to the figure itself, in that one word Rock, a most significant word.  We have touched upon it in other studies, on other occasions. Here we are face to face with the occasion upon which our Lord first used it.  What is this figure of rock   Whereas we use the word <span><img width="39" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3280.gif"/></span> or <span><img width="36" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3281.gif"/></span> or our word stone, the idea is the same. We are looking now merely at the material figure of rock.  There is a distinction to be found in the sixteenth chapter of Matthew, where two words are <span><img width="37" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3282.gif"/></span> connected, cognate words, petros and petra.  Of this same man Jesus there said,   Thou art <span><img width="43" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3283.gif"/></span> and  on this petra, I will build My Church <span><img width="11" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3284.png"/></span> the same general idea is here and a different signification.  When Jesus looked at Peter, He did not say, Thou art <span><img width="31" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3285.gif"/></span> hut, Thou art <span class="s64">petros.  </span>The difference is simply this. <span class="s64">Petros </span>is of the same nature as <span><img width="31" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3286.gif"/></span> but it is a piece of rock.  <span class="s64">Petra </span>is essential rock, the whole fact of rock.

I am not going to apologize for telling you what rock is.  Rock is the consolidation into one, of varied constituents, resulting in strength and durability.  There are of course different kinds of rock.  Break off a piece of the rock, and petros is in your hand.  You may stand or sit down upon essential rock in all its bulk and majesty, and it is the consolidation into one substance of varied constituents, resulting  in  strength  and  durability.   The constituents in their separation may not be characterized necessarily by strength and durability, but when welded and compounded into one, rock is the result.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3290.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3291.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Amid all the varieties, take granite.  It will be agreed that there is no more perfect illustration of the strength of rock, than granite. What is granite ?  What are its varied constituents   Quartz,  feldspar, mica. Quartz is never characterized by durability and strength, neither is feldspar nor mica.  But when these three are compounded together, the strength of the granite is recognized, and its durability. We are not dealing with the question of how it is done.  In the main there are two kinds of rock, igneous and aqueous  in the one the result of fire, and in the other the result of the action of water.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3292.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Jesus said to this man,  Thou shalt be called rock.”  There shall be in thee the consolidation of constituent parts into one compounded whole which shall be characterized by durability and strength.  Some of us know experimentally what our Lord meant.</p><p style="padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">Yes, but <span class="s35">that does not exhaust the meaning of it.   If He employed</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="62" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3293.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">the figure, the natural figure of rock, there was a spiritual significance in it.  This Jew, Simon, was standing facing his Messiah, and hearing Him speak. Whether at the moment he perfectly apprehended the profound significance of that         of rock I am not prepared to say. I am sure he did later. Study his letters and that is found out.  The Messiah looked at this man, not so much looking at him as through him, and He adopted the language of the literature of the Hebrew Scriptures, which was that of expectation.  He had come to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="26" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3294.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">the expectations of that sacred Literature.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="24" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3295.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Therefore we take up this figure of speech in the Old Testament, and go through it to find the references to rock.  There are different Hebrew words translated by that word rock.  There is one meaning the same as <span><img width="31" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3296.gif"/></span> the word     <i>Go </i>through the Old Testament, the history, prophets, and psalms, and that word rock is used figuratively, occurring some forty times, beginning in the book of Deuteronomy. It comes out also in the Psalms.  The arresting fact is that wherever it is so used figuratively, it is reserved for Deity.  I have said Deity, rather than God, and for this reason. There are two occasions only where it is used of false gods, in Deuteronomy xxxii. <b>31 </b>and 37.

It is the great prophetic foreshowing of God manifest in the flesh, the Man a shadow of a great rock in a weary land, and it is full of beauty in that way    but it is always a type of God.   Jesus looked at Peter and said,    Thou shalt be called rock.”  Rock is the symbol of His strength, the strength</p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">of the Almighty, the durability of God.</p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">What is rock in the natural world ?   The consolidation into one of varied constituent parts, resulting in strength and durability.    When that is applied to God, it suggests that His strength results from the perfect harmony of all the facts of His Being in the unity of His God-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="68" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3303.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">head.

They were not, however, addressed to Nathanael alone, but to the group.  There is a sudden transition from the singular to the plural, in what our Lord said. He first talked to Nathanael, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig-tree, believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these. And He said unto him,” but He dropped into the <span><img width="86" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3346.png"/></span> verily I say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.”  There are other occasions in the records, when our Lord did that very thing.  We shall    it later on in this Gospel, when He was talking to Peter, He suddenly dropped into the plural,  Let not your heart be troubled.”  I only emphasize it because the words we are now considering were spoken to the group of disciples round about Him at the time. How many more heard</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Him, of course we have no means of knowing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3347.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">What then was the subject which our Lord was intending to illus- trate when He said that to this group of men ?  Secondly, what was the figure He employed   All that so that we may consider the abiding value of the teaching for us.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3348.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3349.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3350.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3351.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: right;">Turn to the subject illustrated.  Notice the method and setting of the thing Jesus said.  Observe first that He opened with that  formula, Verily, verily.”  Another interesting thing to notice in passing is that John is the only one who announces that Jesus used that formula in that form. No less than twenty-five times in the course of his Gospel it is found. Our Lord introduced something He had to say by that formula,   Verily, verily.”  Matthew, Mark, and Luke all report Him as saying   Verily,” and not one of them uses it twice.  We may ask, Which did He say   My opinion is that John was the more acute listener, and noticed the double affirmation, the Amen, Amen, for that is the word.  It is the method showing that He had something of tremendous importance to say.  The formula always marks urgency. It is as though our Lord had been saying something, and then wished to re-arrest attention, and to fasten attention upon something now to be said of urgent importance.  It is a great study, because wherever it is found it leads to something of urgency, and occurs as a rule in the midst of other statements.  That is the first thing to notice in His</p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">method.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 164pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ANGELS AND LADDER          <span><img width="19" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3352.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3353.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3354.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="16" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3355.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3356.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3357.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3358.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3359.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 17pt;text-align: left;">Then this is the first occasion on record, considering the life of Jesus from the chronological standpoint, when we find Him using the term   Son of man.”  We are here at the beginning of His public ministry.  That was our Lord’s favourite designation of Himself,   the Son of man.”  It is also arresting how constantly He used it.  This is the first occasion, and He always used it of Himself.  We never find anyone else using it of Him in these Gospel records.  No man called Him that. No demon called Him that.  His enemies never called Him that, nor are His friends reported as calling Him that.  It was His own name for Himself, with one exception.  In John xii.    on that day when the Greeks had come to Him, and He was saying things of great import, someone in the crowd said, We know about the Christ, or the Messiah.  What dost Thou mean when Thou sayest, the Son of man must be lifted up.  Who is this Son of man ?  Just once the phrase is found on the lips of enquirers, and evidently the very form of the statement shows it was a peculiar designation for Himself. They felt at that moment He was claiming Messiahship.  His disciples had confessed Him Messiah, and others knew He was claiming it and a voice from the crowd spoke, What is Thy view   Who is this Son of man   Notice that voice linked the phrase which He was using with the idea of the Christ, <i>or </i>the Messiah.  We know about the Christ. Who is the Son of man</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3360.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3361.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3362.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3363.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3364.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Then notice again we are observing the method and setting that this was an immediate answer or response to Nathanael’s confession concerning Him. Nathanael had said,   Thou art the Son of God Thou art the King of Israel.”  Then Jesus, continuing the conversation had said to him, Do you believe because I said I knew you before Philip found you   You shall see greater things than these. Then speaking in the plural, You shall see the heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.   Thou art the Son of God.”  He did not deny it, but what He called Himself on that self-same occasion was  Son of man.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3365.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3366.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3367.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Then the setting of Nathanael’s confession in the presence of our Lord’s supreme knowledge and our Lord’s declaration,   Thou shalt see greater things than these,” and then His interpretation of that.

I do not like the trans- lation   a ladder.”  The Hebrew word literally means a stairway, a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3370.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">terrace.  And he saw Jehovah in the dream, and He was seen standing not at the top of the stairway, as our translation might lead us to think, above it.   No, He was right there, on the earth by the side of Jacob. The ladder, the stairway, was standing. When Jacob woke, he said, God is here   Lo, God is in this place.   He saw the stairway, and there is the picture out of the dream.    Jacob and Jehovah close together, and right from the place where they were close together</p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">in the dream, the sweeping stairway moved up until it was lost in heaven.   Ascending and descending messengers of heaven in their order-angels is the true word, which means in the Old Testament as in the New, messengers-were going up, bearing messages.</p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">They were coming down, bearing messages.    That  is  the picture.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3371.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: left;">I believe Nathanael had been reading about Jacob when he was under the fig-tree.   I believe he had read of his home-coming when God crippled him to make him Isra-el. That was all in his mind, I believe, and our Lord took as His illustration the first description of him, the things he had been thinking about under the fig-tree, in the place of his quietness and his devotion. Have you believed because you were told I knew you before Philip found you     You shall see greater things.   You shall see heaven opened, as Jacob did, when he was going out from home.   You shall see heaven open, and you shall see what Jacob saw, angels ascending and descending upon the stair- way, and the way shall be the Son of man.   The figure He was using was that of the ancient dream.</p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">What did that mean to Jacob at the time ?   It was a revelation of Jehovah’s care for him, of Jehovah’s love of him.    I stress again the point that how at that moment he was going away from home under</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a cloud.  Nobody can defend his action by which he gained what he felt he ought to have, the birthright from Esau. We do not defend Jacob there.  It was his in the economy of God, but we really do not help God, but postpone the realization of His purpose when by tricks</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="11" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3372.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">we try to aid Him   bringing it about.   So it was for this man. He was going out under a cloud.  Of <i>course </i>distances to-day are so different.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Take the map, and look at his journey. The country from which</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">he passed, and the country to which he was going.   It meant complete exile from home.  One can easily imagine his restlessness that night, and his sense of loneliness, accentuated by the conviction that it was his own wrongdoing that was driving him out. He had this vision, and he found that God was there.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3373.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3374.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 103pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">When he awoke, what did he say     This is none other than the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3375.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">ANGELS AND LADDER</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3376.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3377.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3378.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">house of God  this is the gate of heaven.”   But he said something far more than that, He said,   Lo, God is here, He is in this place, and I knew it not.”  Mark the tenses there.

But that vision, the Lord standing there, Jehovah manifesting Himself in his dream as there, was close to him    and lo, the stairway and angels going up, and coming down, and Jacob learned that night how God cared.   We cannot go on with that, for it is a sordid story.  The <span class="s25">very </span>next thing we find is Jacob bargaining with God.    If You do so and so, I will do so and so.   He was a mean soul.  Neverthe- less that great revelation had come. That was the vision our Lord recalled to the mind of Nathanael when He said,    Greater things,” and greater things are included in these.    Thou shall see the heaven</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">opened and angels ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">In that whole scene, and in that use of the figure of speech gathered from a piece of history in the sacred writings with which Nathanael was most familiar, undoubtedly there stands for us for evermore a revelation of the fact of the interrelationship between heaven and earth, that they are not divided, that they are not so far apart, that earth can have dealing with heaven, and heaven dealing with earth. That was the general lesson taught by the vision of Jacob, and that was the tremendous fact Jesus had come to teach humanity at large.</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Mark how the two spheres merge in His own Personality, the Son of God and the Son of man.   He belonged to the heavenly abode and the heavenly region and the heavenly order. Yes, but He belonged</p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">to the earthly region and abode and order. He was Son of man. Heaven and earth were linked in His Person.    And it was an unveiling of that fact that He announced to men through Himself. Through Him the door closed should be opened.   The Old Version rendered it,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3381.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3382.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Thou shalt see heaven open.”   The Revisers have it,   Ye shall see the heaven opened.”  The very form in which it is stated suggests the fact the door was shut, that man had somehow lost his connection,</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">his sense of relationship with the heavenly world and order.

Of course we have got beyond medieval art.    Modern art knows nothing of the angels. We have lost the angels in our thinking, and  <span class="s25">our </span>philosophy. We do not believe in angels. No, we are largely Sadducean   They believed neither in resurrection, angel,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3386.gif"/></span></p><p class="s54" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 131pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">or spirit.

He knew the Scriptures in His human life.  He knew of the angelic visitation and ministry, remembering possibly that very word,   The angel of the Lord campeth round about them that fear Him.”  At any rate He said that the ministry of heavenly beings should be maintained between heaven and the earth upon Him, and through Him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3391.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3392.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3393.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="24" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3394.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3395.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3396.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">The writer of the letter to the Hebrews had a strong conviction about angels when he said,   Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation The word   ministering   is liturgical, that is the <span><img width="60" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3397.gif"/></span> of Greek word. The double function of the angels is revealed in that great word. First they are liturgical.  That is their supreme function, that of adoration in worship in the presence of the eternal Throne, and the ineffable glory of God.  Go back to Isaiah, and we find that in the vision Isaiah had, he saw the seraphim, and saw them engaged in liturgical service. They were crying out,   Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of hosts   the whole earth is full of His glory.” That is praise, that is worship, that is liturgical service, and the writer of the Hebrew letter says that is their function.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">But sometimes that exercise ceases.  They are sent forth to minister, to do service to those who are heirs of salvation, the ministry of angels on behalf of such.  Again that is seen in that very passage of Isaiah. He saw that vision of the angels, heard their anthems, and then it was he cried, Lo, I am a man of unclean lips. Then one of them was sent forth to catch from the altar the live coal, and touch the lips of the sinner, and cleanse him. They are sent forth to minister.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3398.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3399.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">This is not out of date. There are very many things we know for certain that we cannot prove.  My last word is that of testimony. I am sure we are surrounded by angel ministry,   angels ascending and descending upon the Son of man.” The angel ministry had largely ceased until He was near, then coming again, in the <span><img width="42" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3400.gif"/></span><span class="s33"> </span>one appeared, to Zacharias, and another to Mary.

He had come down from where the great sign had been wrought.   He had travelled down with His Mother and His brethren to Capernaum, and He had stayed there   not many days.”  The Passover feast was about to be observed in Jerusalem.  He travelled up there, and it would seem that He went directly to the Temple, for that is the first thing we read.</p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">We are told what He found when He arrived there, the desecration of His Father’s house, that desecration taking place in the Gentile courts.  It is well to remember that, because those who bought and sold and changed money, would not have allowed that in the courts strictly set apart to the Jew.   It was a sign of the times that they felt the Gentile courts were only of value as they might help the Jew as he came up to his worship.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3406.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Notice our Lord included everything in His description,    My Father’s  house.”   That included the Gentile courts where this business was being carried on. We know what He did. He cleansed those courts.  It is a graphic picture, told in simple yet sublime language by John.  He did the same thing again at the close of His ministry.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3407.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">Here He made a whip, a scourge of small cords.

Person- ally I believe that with that symbolic scourge in His hands, He advanced</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="42" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3408.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3409.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3410.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">upon that crowd, and there was a majesty in His mien that they saw something of His might.   If He hit anyone, I am sure it hurt them, but I am not careful about that. This        view of Jesus that He would not hit a man, is not true.   That, however, is the background. He cleansed the Temple, and drove out the animals, and overturned the tables of the money-changers, and sent the whole crowd out.    He said to those in charge of the doors,   Take these things hence  make not My Father’s house a house of merchandise.” Do you suppose</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3411.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">He spoke with any other voice than anger, when He said that     If you imagine so, you have a different view of our Lord from my own.</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">He cleansed the Temple.</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">It was that occasion that led up to the word we are to consider.

It was a challenge as to His authority, although they did not, on that occasion, according to the record, use the word, authority.   Later, however, in the same Temple, they used the word.   Matthew records it in his twenty-first chapter, Mark in his eleventh, and Luke in his twentieth. They all record the fact that the rulers came to Him, and asked,    By what authority doest Thou these things     In the fifth chapter of John’s Gospel (v. <span><img width="20" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3421.gif"/></span> when our Lord was dealing with these rulers, said of His relationship to God,   He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of man.”</p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">That was the whole question that was raised here.    He did these things by some power that was irresistible. What right had He to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3422.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3423.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3424.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">do them   What was His authority ?   What they asked for was a sign of His authority. That was the background. Following our habit, we first consider a little more particularly the subject illustrated when our Lord made use of these words    then look at the figure employed when He said,   Destroy this temple  <span><img width="11" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3425.png"/></span> and finally, neces- sarily, the teaching deduced.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3426.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3427.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">What was the subject under consideration on the day that our Lord said,   Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up    ? He had been challenged concerning His right to exercise authority, that was evidently kingly, that was also priestly, to say nothing of</p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the prophetic office.  He had been challenged as to what right He had to usurp the position of a king, and of a priest, and to interfere with the orderly and permitted arrangements of the Temple. That was the subject.</p><p style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">The parabolic illustration that we are taking does not declare His authority, does not declare its nature, but as a sign it reveals it. That is what they wanted, and that is what He gave them.     In those mystic words He intended to illustrate His authority, and the supreme proof of that authority.   It is a great question, that of the authority of our Lord. Take the thought and watch it through. These men</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 154pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE TEMPLE OF HIS BODY         <span class="s33">23.5</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">were challenging Him there. They doubted that He had any adequate authority, and in order to find out, as they thought, they wanted something to prove it.   If an adequate proof of authority could be found, the nature of the authority would be revealed.    That <span class="s60">is </span>what our Lord was doing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3428.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3429.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3430.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 73pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: left;">What was the figure He employed    He said,   Destroy this temple.”  He used a word that everyone sees, and that men then saw, referred to the place where He was.   He had gone up to the Temple. He was in the Temple, and their minds instinctively went out to the Temple. It was the centre of national and religious life. They had not forgotten the deep things of their own history.    The Temple was the very dwelling-place and Throne of God.    In that place He used that figure,   Destroy this temple.”   The marginal reading here is sanctuary, and that is an attempt to show a distinction.

John is honest enough to tell us that after He had risen from the dead they understood what He had said.</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">The secret of His authority is demonstrated by His death and His resurrection.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3464.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3465.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3466.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3467.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3468.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Later on we have the same thing with other wording. Matthew has told us   certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, Master, we would seek a sign from Thee.” Listen to His answer.    An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 148pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE TEMPLE OF HIS BODY         <span><img width="23" height="20" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3469.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.”  Those two great facts of His death and resurrection constitute the sign and the only sign of the authority of the Son of man.   In having the sign of authority, He revealed the nature of His authority; His right to cleanse the temple, His right to heal, His right to do whatever He did was vested in the mystery of His death, and the marvel of His resurrection.   If it is said to-day, and it is terribly true, there are multitudes of people who are seeking a sign, and ques- tioning His authority, they constitute an evil and adulterous generation.</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">That sign abides.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3470.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3471.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">If any ask for proof of the final authority of Christ as King, and Priest, where is it found  <span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3472.gif"/></span>  Not in His teaching, great and vital as it was and is  not in those signs that we speak of as His miracles, marvels as they were   not in the example of His perfect life, radiant and beautiful in holiness as it was.

It was on that occasion that Nicodemus, a ruler, and the teacher in Israel sought an interview with Him. There is significance in the phrase that he was   the teacher of Israel.”   To use a phrase of these times, he was the popular teacher, a man greatly sought after, as    I believe because of the eminence of his intellect and his acquaintance with the Holy Scriptures.   I think that is what our Lord meant when He said,   Art thou <i>the teacher </i>of Israel, and understandeth not these things     Be that as it may, he certainly was a teacher and ruler.</p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">This was the man who sought an interview with Jesus.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3487.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">The first twenty-one verses of this chapter give us the story of that interview.   Some believe that the words of our Lord recorded in this chapter ceased at the fifteenth verse, and that the paragraph com- mencing,   For God so loved the world,” constituted John’s inter- pretation of what our Lord was saying. Without arguing about it,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3488.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3489.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I reject that view, and am convinced the words in verse sixteen fell from the lips of our Lord Himself.   In the midst, however, of the story of the interview with Nicodemus, our Lord used two illustrations, one from Nature, and the other from the history of the nation of Israel. The one from Nature was,   The wind bloweth where it listeth  <span><img width="11" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3490.png"/></span> the <span class="s47">other from the history of  </span><span><img width="34" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3491.gif"/></span><span class="s47"> with which Nicodemus would be </span>familiar,   As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness.” We are now concerned with the first of these, considering the second   <i>in </i>our next study.</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">The wind and the Spirit.

Christ had declared to him that the Kingdom of God demands a new personality.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3498.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">He told him that no man could see it unless he was born   <span><img width="42" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3499.gif"/></span> from above  <i>a </i>new personality.

On these two occasions we have a different rendering.   It is a word used of God, of man, and of demons.  The word in itself means quite literally, apart from its high value, a current of air, a breath, a breeze.    The root of it is in that passage in Acts,   a mighty rushing wind.” Here there can be no doubt whatever that our Lord used the wind, the breath, the breeze as illustrating the fact of the work of the Spirit.    There is <span class="s39">no </span>question that our translators were right in rendering it    <span><img width="26" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3539.gif"/></span> in the text, not as in the margin.</p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">It is interesting, though not important, that possibly Jesus and Nicodemus were on the house-top  <span class="s35">together in the night.

If they were in the house, probably they heard the sighing and the soughing of the wind going up the narrow streets of Jerusalem.    Whether on the house-top, in the house, or in a garden, as my beloved friend Dr. Jowett believed, the one thing Jesus did here, as He was so constantly doing, was to take hold of something close to Him, the meaning of which the one to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3540.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">whom He was speaking could not but be conscious.

Let the pleasantry be forgotten, and take this fact. Nicodemus heard the wind blowing over the house-top.  The sound demonstrated the fact of the wind.  I will tell you what you do not know, Nicodemus.  You do not know whence it came.  You do not know whither it is going. You are in the presence of a reality demonstrated.

What a marvellous illustration. Keep it against its background. Remember Nicodemus’ false question, his false illustration  our Lord’s correction of it, and His insistence upon the spiritual fact, a new personality by the birth of the Spirit.  Carefully notice one thing in this.   The wind bloweth where it Iisteth, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth    is everyone born of the Spirit.”  It is of the utmost importance that we get the reality of the terms in their right relationship here. Jesus did not say the wind blows where it will, and so is the Spirit in His action.  It was not a comparison in the ultimate between the wind and the Spirit. They are both there.  It was a comparison between the man Nicodemus and that other Man.  Thou hearest the sound thereof, and by that thou knowest the reality  but thou     not tell whence it cometh or whither it goeth.  Thou standest in the presence of mystery    is everyone that is born of the Spirit.  Nicodemus, thy relation for the moment to this natural phenomenon is exactly the same relation a man born of the Spirit bears to that phenomenon.  What is the similitude as to the wind   The wind is a demonstrated fact. There is a mystery in its operation.  As to the Spirit, to the man born of the Spirit the fact is equally demonstrated by the results.  So as thou art listening to the wind, not being sure of it    he that is born of the Spirit knows it incontrovertibly by its operation. As thou     not tell whence or whither the wind cometh and goeth    every man born of the Spirit has to recognize the mystery of the operation.  He may not be able to explain whence or whither.  He may not be able to unravel the tremendous mystery of the rebirth of personality in the realm of the Spirit   but he knows the fact. The fact is there, and the mystery is there.</p><p style="padding-left: 112pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">Now to summarize.  This illustration consisted of a reinforcement</p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and an appeal to employ the same activity in the things of the Spirit as in the things of Nature.  In the realm of Nature we recognize the fact. We are conscious of the mystery. Do the same thing in the realm</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 133pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE WIND AND THE SPIRIT         <span class="s29">243</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3566.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of the Spirit.  Act on the fact, and in accordance with it, recognizing all the while the mystery of the method.   Our Lord only spoke of one demonstration of the wind.   It was that of the sound, of a voice.   That was what they were conscious of there in the night time.    There are other demonstrations of the wind.   One is power.  We know the power of the wind   still we do not know whence it  <span><img width="44" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3567.gif"/></span> or whither it goeth.  The mystery is there, but the fact is there.   <span class="s80">So </span>is everyone that is born of the Spirit.   Our Lord is really saying in effect, Nicodemus,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3568.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">if you will act in the realm of the Spirit as you do most honestly in the realm of Nature, where will you find yourself     Take the realm of Nature, and take the wind. Apply the old and familiar formula, Obey the law of the force, and the force will obey you.    Obey the law of the wind, and the wind will fill the sails of the vessel and carry it across the waters.   If you obey the force, and the force becomes your servant, you still do not understand the mystery. In the realm of Nature no man stands debating a mystery, and neglecting the force.</p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">That is what Christ was saying in the realm of the Spirit.    Obey the</p><p style="padding-left: 57pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">law of the Spirit, and the Spirit will obey you.   Obey the law of the spiritual life, and the result will be that all the forces of that life will demonstrate the reality of that birth which is the birth from above, which is the birth of the Spirit.</p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">We can take that tremendous statement and turn it round in another way.  Disobey the law of the force, and the force will destroy you, That is always so. Disobey the law of the wind, and the wind will wreck your vessel.   Obey the law of the force, and it will obey you. It is true of electricity.   It is always true.   Obey the law of electricity and it becomes your servant, lighting your buildings, driving    <span class="s35">your </span>vehicles, and all the things it is doing to-day. But disobey the</p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">law of that force, and it will blast you like the lightning of death.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3569.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">It was no light thing Jesus said, and it was a tremendous   <span><img width="42" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3570.gif"/></span> tion.  Nicodemus, you hear the wind.   You know the fact of the wind because you heard just now the voice of the wind   but you are stand- ing in the presence of a mystery.   Nicodemus, you must be born of water, which is the action of repentance, and the Spirit, which is</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3571.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">the action of regeneration.    Though you do not understand the mystery, obey the law, and the force will become your servant    and even though physically you cannot enter into your mother’s womb and be born again, yet in the great mystery of personality, central to which is spirit always, you can be born again, be born anew, be born from above, and find that new personality through which you shall understand and experience the Kingdom of God.</p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 108pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">244    <span class="p">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3572.gif"/></span></p></li><li data-list-text="49."><p class="s56" style="padding-left: 228pt;text-indent: -37pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;">The Lifted Serpent John <span class="p">iii </span><span class="s97">14</span></p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="14" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3573.gif"/></span></p><p class="s96" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 27pt;text-align: left;">0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s12" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 125pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">PREVIOUS <span class="p">study was concerned with the illustration of the wind and the Spirit, by which our Lord illuminated His answer</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3574.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3575.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to the first question of Nicodemus,   How can a man be born when hc is old    Nicodemus then spoke again, and Jesus employed the illustration of the lifted serpent in His answer to that second question,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3576.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3577.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">How can these things be</p><p style="padding-left: 106pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">We pause here to notice that there was an essential difference between the two questions which Nicodemus asked.

He did not deny what Christ had suggested as to the value of a new beginning.  Jesus said,   Except a man be born from above he cannot see the Kingdom of God.”   Nicodemus did not question that for a moment.  What he did question was the possibility of the thing</p><p style="padding-left: 105pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">suggested.  How can a man be born all over again, as though the first had never been.  He is what he is as the result of all the years that have gone.  How can he start again ?

That is what He is now doing.   He had told him the earthly things, the necessity on the earth level for a new per- sonality.  He had illustrated that by a natural figure of speech, the blowing of the wind.  He had told him earthly things, and Nicodemus was still in doubt. He could not understand. How would he believe</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3591.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3592.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 56pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">if He drew aside the curtain and revealed the heavenly things. The earthly things declared were those of necessity for a man to be born from above, starting anew on the earth level.   Nicodemus, you ask how that can be brought about    The answer is that which brings you face to face with <span><img width="48" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3593.gif"/></span> things  the action of heaven that makes  <span><img width="42" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3594.gif"/></span><span class="s29"> </span>the earthly experience.   Our Lord dealt with that from this point on,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3595.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3596.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3597.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 55pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: left;">the action whereby a man can, by the reception of a new life from above, escape from his past.   That is what had puzzled Nicodemus at first, how he could not only see but enter into the whole experience of the Kingdom of God.   The secret of the life which liberates a human soul, and enables it, how that life is provided straight away,     As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up  that whosoever believeth may in Him have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish, but have eternal life.   For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world  but that the world should be saved through Him.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3598.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">Those are the heavenly things.   The earthly things, the necessity for the recreating of personality, the liberation of the soul from the accumulation and influences of the past, and the enablement of the <span class="s98">soul </span>with a new life to enter upon the Kingdom of God experimentally these are the earthly things.   You ask for the heavenly secrets.   How will you believe if I do tell you ? And the great declaration comes,  with  the sixteenth  verse, always  taken  in  very close connection with the fourteenth and fifteenth, and also with the seventeenth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="2" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3599.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3600.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Notice how those two verses (16, 17) begin  <span><img width="11" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3601.png"/></span> For   for.”  That follows after the verse,   As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilder-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="23" height="29" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3602.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3603.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up    that whosoever believeth may in Him have eternal life.

As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness.”   Having first used an illustration in the realm of natural phenomena, He now used an illustration in the realm</p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of historic record. Nicodemus knew the Old Testament. He was the teacher of Israel, and he knew the Scriptures.   We are familiar with it. The story is in Numbers xxi.,  the account of how Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness.</p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">In looking at this figure, what did this uplifted serpent   mean ? <b>Why </b>did Moses lift up that serpent in the wilderness   <span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3606.gif"/></span>  Because the people had been guilty of definite and positive rebellion against God.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3607.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3608.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There is one little sentence in that twenty-first chapter of Numbers that tells the whole story.     They spake against God.” That is the history behind this incident. The people definitely and wilfully rebelled against the Divine government.     They spake against God,” and this story in Numbers tells us that as the result of that rebellion</p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">there was a punitive action of God. There came to them the fiery serpents, and the deadly bite, and the terrible anguish and suffering.</p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">But  we  have  not  reached  the  lifted  serpent.  That  is  only the background.    Why  was  the  serpent  lifted  ?  It  was  lifted because the people had rebelled against God, and because as the result of their rebellion they were suffering punishment. That was why.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3609.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">Now, said Jesus, as Moses lifted up that serpent   and we go back with the simplicity of children to the story in Numbers, and say, Why did Moses lift it up, and what did it mean when it was lifted up ?    First,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3610.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">he lifted it up by the authority of God, by the authority of the very One against Whom the people were in rebellion.     They spake against God,” and that God Whose authority they were insulting and denying arranged for the uplifted serpent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3611.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3612.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3613.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Why was it lifted ?  To give those who were suffering as the result of their own rebellion an opportunity for return to the government of God.  Let us get hold of that first.   I know there is something else. What were they to do    Moses was to make a serpent of brass, and lift it on a pole. What were they to do ? Look at the serpent of brass. It sounds almost foolish. It is not. Is there any healing in that serpent of brass ?   No, not so  no healing in it.   Then why look Because God’s authority commanded it. His authority had been</p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">insulted. His authority ordered the elevation of that serpent, and men were to look, and there could be no look which was not the result of yielding to the Divine authority in a new start, a new beginning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="61" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3614.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The God         is now obeyed by those who look.   There were hundreds who looked. It was a speculative look. There were those who did not look.  We do know if they did not look they died by the</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 157pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE LIFTED SERPENT          <span><img width="23" height="20" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3615.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3616.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3617.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">poison of the bite.  But the look was a yielding to a Divine command, and that is all.  The work of the eyes had nothing in it of value.  There was no healing in that uplifted serpent  but in obedience to a Divine command. So Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness  first upon the authority of God, and secondly to create for suffering men and women through their own sin an opportunity of return to the government of God that they had refused, by obedience to His command as they looked.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3618.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Of course the third thing is involved in what we have said.  That demanded repentance, a change of mind  an activity that grows out of a changed mind.  If men and women in that camp heard the pro-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3619.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">clamation that God had appointed the lifted serpent, with the act of every head turned towards that serpent was the head of a repentant man  indicating a change of mind, no longer speaking against God, but obeying God.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Finally, of course, on the fulfilment of these conditions a way of healing and of new life was provided for those smitten, stricken, and afflicted through their own sin. That was the story in Numbers. Moses lifted up the serpent on the authority of God to create a point at which man who had spoken against Him and was in rebellion, and  consequently  was  suffering,  could  turn  back,  and  by  looking be healed and restored, in glorious simplicity of obedience to the command.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3620.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Yet the sublime wonder of it.  Every head turned was the head of someone who was repenting and now obeying the Divine command and as and whenever a head was turned in obedience, expressed in the look, life and healing followed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="10" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3621.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3622.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3623.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3624.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">Nicodemus, you know your history. You have asked about heavenly things,  Let Me begin by taking you back to a page   your history, as though Jesus had said, that well-known story of the serpent and there you will see heavenly activity creating the opportunity for <span><img width="41" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3625.gif"/></span> activity  and when the heavenly activity and the earthly come into touch with each other, there is the way of life.   As . . .</p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="22" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3626.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3627.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3628.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">So we stand back as it were from the illustration, and at once see the greatness of it.  There is revealed and suggested in this story in the wilderness the background of human need. What is it   Man perishing by reason of his rebellion against God.  That is the whole story of this world’s agony and failure.  That is the story of the failure of your life and mine. That is the story of the failure of all social <span><img width="75" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3629.gif"/></span>  That is the story of failure in national life, and inter- national relationships.  All in the last analysis is in rebellion against God  and perishing is the result.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3630.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">There is only one hope either for the individual or for the nation. What is it   A new beginning, a new birth, the communication of a new life which will liberate us from all the bondage of the past,</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span><img width="19" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3631.gif"/></span>   <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3632.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3633.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3634.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">and enable us for all that lies ahead of us.  I go back twenty years for my illustration, to those dark and terrible years.  How constantly it was repeated in writings of men who perhaps would not claim what we would claim, of confidence and belief in the Christ of God  but over and over again we were told that what the world needed was a new spirit.  It is wonderful how all unconsciously these men simply repeated what Jesus said,   Ye must be born from above.” There is the background. Nicodemus was there, and Jesus was talking to him, and as He used this illustration, at the time showing the back- ground in the history of men and women perishing by reason of re- bellion, with no hope whatever   then something happened so that they should be healed, and have a new element in life.  So we see the condition of the world, and humanity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3635.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3636.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3637.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Now in the foreground, our Lord told him the story of the Divine action.   As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be Iifted up.”   Lifted up  ?  Everyone knows what He meant,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="11" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3638.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="2" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3639.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="2" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3640.gif"/></span></p><p class="s48" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 201pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lifted up, was He, to die.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3641.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3642.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3643.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">That is what He meant. It is a great expression. We find it again upon the lips of Jesus (viii. <span><img width="20" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3644.gif"/></span>  He was talking then to His enemies. Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am He, and that I do nothing from Myself, but as the Father taught Me, I speak these things.” And once again, we have the phrase on the lips of Jesus in the twelfth chapter, in that marvellous  word,   I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Myself.”  He used the expression then when He was looking at the Cross, and more than the Cross He was looking through to the victory.  So He said to Nicodemus,  The Son of man must be lifted</p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">up.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3645.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3646.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3647.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3648.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">So we are brought face to face with the Cross in a remarkable way by reason of the illustration.  The serpent was lifted up by the authority of God.  So was the Son of man.  The lifting up on the Cross of Jesus was not finally the act of man.  It was the act of man’s sin  but He never had been lifted up except, again to quote from Peter, in his first Pentecostal sermon, He had been   delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God.”  Behind that Cross I see the eternal  Throne.  In that Cross I see the action of the eternal authority. That which man has condemned and rebelled against is acting in the midst of all the ruin, created by his rebellion, for the recovery of man from those results  by the authority of God creating an opportunity for man to return to the Divine authority. That is what it always means.  It is so wrong to think we become Christians to escape the bite of the fiery serpent, or hell fire.  Yes, we do  but to become a Christian means we get back to God, yielding to the authority which has been <span><img width="64" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3649.gif"/></span> and against which man has rebelled.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 179pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">LIVING WATER            <span><img width="26" height="20" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3650.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">That demands repentance, but it provides life, and healing for all who will be obedient to that command.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3651.gif"/></span></p><p class="s48" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 113pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">There is life for a look at the Crucified  <span class="s51">One,</span></p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">There is life at this moment for thee.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3652.gif"/></span></p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 122pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;">Then look, sinner, look unto Him and be saved There is life in that moment for thee.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3653.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3654.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="40" height="18" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3655.png"/></span></p><p class="s48" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 67pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But <span class="s51">there must be the look.

What are the things necessary to life on the material level, the natural ?    I will state them in the order of importance, from the least to the greatest.    The first is food, that is the least important, but it is essential.    We can certainly live forty days without eating.   It is interesting the occasions of fasting recorded in the Bible for forty days.   But more important than food is water.  How long can we live without water   Scientists tell us seven days, and no more. Of course the most important is breath.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3681.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="20" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3682.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3683.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How long can we live without breathing    I    not attempt an answer   We need to breathe, that is the first thing. We need water, and we need food. But this illustration was taken there,</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">the second in importance as an element of life-water, that is the figure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3684.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Look at the figure. There is more than that in it    only I would remind you that thirst is a beneficent warning of danger.    Thirst in its demand, is a search after deliverance from the danger.    A man with no consciousness, no thirst for spiritual things, is in dire danger.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3685.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3686.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="23" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3687.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3688.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="22" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3689.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="2" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3690.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="32" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3691.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3692.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3693.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: left;">Thirst is beneficent.   It is a warning, and it means a clamant cry for that which will obviate the peril. It was not merely water in this figure of speech   it was the place of water.   Notice how the well plays a part   through here.   Now for a small technicality, which is worth noting.  In the narrative there are two entirely different words, both translated     It is significant.   Look at verses eleven and twelve. The woman is talking, and she says,    The    is deep   our father Jacob, which gave us the      That was her thought and conception, which was perfectly true.

She was thinking of the accumulated water there in the well, in the cistern.   Now look at verses six and fourteen.

Take the other word in the figure of speech, as Jesus used it,    living water.” What is living water   I am not thinking of the spiritual realm merely.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3703.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3704.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3705.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">There was living water there in that sense, or that well would not have been in use after the long centuries.   Jacob had given it to his sons. There it was, an accumulation of water   someone drew out, and the cistern remained and filled up again, why    Because there was living water there.  What then is living water, as distinct from cistern water</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3706.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is water always flowing, as distinct from water gathered up, and kept.  There is a beautiful phrase in the Old Testament on the material or physical level, where we are told in the Book of Genesis that Isaac’s servants digged in the valley   and found there a well of springing water.”  That is the same thought, living water, water always coming up, always passing on.   We shall consider the figure again later on,</p><p style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in another and wider application.   Now we are simply looking at the figure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3707.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3708.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">Living water is water always bubbling up and flowing, always coming.  Water in a glass by our side, is excellent, but it is not living water   it is stagnant, it is collected.   Water ceases to be living when it is gathered, and stored and kept.   Jesus used that as a figure, living water   not the well in which there is an accumulation of water, but a spring that keeps the well full, however much water is drawn from it.</p><p style="padding-left: 81pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">What a wonderful figure of speech, living water. Jesus is con- fronting a thirsty soul, and is using the illustration that is close at hand. The woman called it a well. He spoke of a spring, of that which had brought the water into the well.

What this figure Jesus used   The lamp.  Scholars are all agreed in what may not be quite patent to the ordinary reader, that when Jesus used that word   the lamp,” not a lamp, although that might quite well have been said, there was a great definiteness in it. So careful a scholar as Westcott emphasizes the fact that Jesus was taking something quite familiar to them, that which they could see in any house   that the definite article,   the lamp,” points to the familiar</p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">household object. That is the figure, that of the <span><img width="28" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3781.gif"/></span>  burning. Our minds  go  wandering  there  helpfully.  We remember that Jesus said, No man lights a lamp, or a candle, the same word, and puts it under a bushel There He took the same figure. It is the ordinary, everyday  figure  of  the  lamp,  shining  in  the  house,  and  giving light.</p><p style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Look at that lamp for a moment.  We recognize first that it has no light in itself, but it is a centre of light, when the illuminating essence is supplied, and ignition takes place.  It is always so.  It is so even to-day with the lights round about us. It is very remarkable how underlying principles do not change.  Of course when Jesus was talking the lamp was the light, with the wick and oil.  I am old enough to remember that was the illumination in my home in boyhood, just a lamp, with wick and oil. But that lamp never lighted the house. Then I am still old enough to remember when the lamp was super- seded by gas.  They put in all the fittings, and some of them were fearfully <span class="s72">and </span>wonderfully made, brackets on the walls and chandeliers.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 148pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE LAMP OF PROPHECY         <span class="s29">2.57</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3782.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: left;">But look at them, there is no light. The bracket and the burner give no light. Now the very homes who used that method, have electric light, and no one knows exactly what it is.  What do we do We wire our buildings, and put in fixtures, and bulbs, or something else, but there is no light in them.  The lamps do not light the building. The light comes when some illuminating essence is supplied, and ignition takes place. In the old days ignition took place with the tinder  box.  The tinder was struck on flint until a spark smouldered, and you blew it, and touched the wick with it, and by that fire it became a centre of light. It is the same with the gas burner. The tap was turned on, and it was touched with fire, and the room was lit, the house was lit. Now we have gone beyond all that. We do not have to touch anything with fire ourselves. We do not have to put a match to the gas burner, but we just press a lever, and there is a flash somewhere of fire, and there is light.  But there is no light in the lamp, gas burner, or bulb.  Something more is wanted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3783.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Still look at the lamp. What brings the light  Burning, always burning, always fire.  There is no light apart from fire, from the sun</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="29" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3784.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3785.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">to the wax     there must be burning.  Burning in the case of the lamp with the wick and the oil, burning always means consuming. While it bums it is being consumed, and by the consuming of the oil, touched with fire upon the basis of the wick, light is given, and it is not consumed. If that consuming process fails, if it becomes over- charged with charcoal, or fails to supply the oil, the light is snuffed out. We must have burning, and burning means consuming. What- ever we see in a lamp is transitory.  It is not going on all the time. Presently it will consume by itself, burning  and out goes the burning, shining.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3786.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="20" height="15" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3787.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3788.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3789.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 17pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">But  because  burning,  shining,  and  so  illuminating,  and  always <span><img width="17" height="17" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3790.gif"/></span> the process of burning.  That was our Lord’s figure. Said He of John   He was the lamp that burneth    shineth.”  I would venture to suggest the introduction of a little word there.   He was the lamp that burneth and so shineth.”  There is no shining without burning and  any  burning  that  does  not  issue  in  shining  falls  back  into ashes, and the light ceases. John was the lamp that burned and shined.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="43" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3791.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">The teaching deduced is so simple and on the surface that we do not tarry with it.

Yes, what a great work he did, what a marvellous work  but a work which was consuming, and therefore transitory, and must presently find its end.</p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3794.gif"/></span></p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span><img width="19" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3795.gif"/></span>   <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3796.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="14" height="2" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3797.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3798.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">It did find its end.  <span class="s41">I am using </span>the word in its true and beautiful sense.

Go back through the history of these marvellous prophets, those we call mis- takenly major and minor, the prophetic utterances, and it is true that they were never self-luminous. Their light was derivative. We hear them again and again as we study them saying,  Thus saith the Lord,” and they were shining.  They were lights in dark places  and indeed, the  prophetic  ministry  is  always  characterized  by  darkness  round about it.  Apart from the darkness there is no call for the prophetic ministry. The prophet is always shining in a dark place  but he is shining because he is burning. He is being consumed, and in the consuming process light is shining and flashing everywhere.   To Him bare all the prophets witness.”  What high honour, and what grave responsibility.  It is the responsibility of a lamp well trimmed, supplied with oil, burning   and there responsibility ends.

The lad with the five loaves and the two small fishes had been there   and Jesus had taken those five loaves and had blessed them, and broken them, and multiplied them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="38" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3828.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 138pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">spring-time when He blessed the bread, ‘Twas harvest when He brake.”</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So they had been fed.  Because they had been supernaturally fed on the previous day, the crowds had come together.   That is what brought</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">260   PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3829.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">them back.  We are not unfair to them in saying that, because Jesus said to them, in verse twenty-six,    Ye seek Me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled.”    They ate loaves yesterday, and they had come back to-day. Whereas it does not say so in so many words, they hoped for another manifestation</p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of power.  They did not take any cognizance of the sign it was intended to signify.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3830.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3831.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: left;">It was with this attitude Jesus was dealing when He made use of this figure of speech. He said to them (v. 27)    Work not for the meat which perisheth, but for the meat which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of man shall give unto you   for Him the Father, even God, hath sealed.”   So He rebuked their materialism of effort. Do not work for the meat which perishes.   They had worked,  <i>some of </i>them, pretty hard, in the hope of a meal that day.    They had gone all round the lake.  They had put out a good deal of effort to get there, to find Him. They did not want to understand. They were not seeking for interpretation. The sign did not appeal to them. The thing that brought them  there was the fact of their full bellies yesterday.   He  rebuked  that, and  called  them  to  another  kind of effort, of output, of strength  that  resulted  in  the  meat  that</p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">did not perish, that would bring them to the place of meat that endureth to eternal Iife. That is the subject which our Lord was illustrating.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3832.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3833.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">Now look at the figure in itself, bread, the bread of life. We are not touching the spiritual level yet   though in dealing with the figure, of <i>course, we </i>begin to see into the spiritual significance.   Stay, however, with the figure. The bread of life was a common phrase.

It does not mean flesh, but all sorts of food.

It is always considered so.   All other articles of food were looked upon as accessory   permissible, but unnecessary. Bread was the</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">principal food, and was looked upon then as having a sanctity all its own. Go to the East to-day, and it will be found whether among Arabs, Jews, or other members of that land, they never tread under foot a piece of bread.   However soiled it is, however smirched or contaminated, they never put their foot on it.   An Arab walking down one of the highways, seeing a piece of bread would be careful not to</p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">put his foot on it. He would be careful to pick it up, and put it in a niche in the wall for the pariahs.   The reason is because there is still</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 163pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE BREAD OF LIFE           <span><img width="23" height="18" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3841.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">a great and peculiar sense of the element of sacredness in bread, because it comes from God. That is true of the East, where Jesus was speaking, and of the thinking of the people to whom He was speaking.  Bread stood for necessary food.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3842.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3843.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3844.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">In Genesis iii.  <span class="s7">IO </span>we find it said,   In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.”   That did not merely mean an article of food made out of barley or wheat meal   but it meant food   and from there all the way through the word bread refers to food generally.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3845.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">So it does here.   The emphasis is laid upon that peculiar food which was the general source of sustenance in the East.</p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">sanctity was always remembered, because of its symbolism in the East.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3846.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Bread always stood for hospitality and for fellowship   and men in the East broke bread with one another, the one providing it offering hospitality, and those partaking, were united in fellowship.   While we are not yet dealing with the spiritual things, they are shining through.</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our Lord used a figure of speech.

For the time being we call ourselves British so as to cover all the English, Scotch, Welsh, and Irish. That is a race.

When considering the subject of the living water we said that the three essential things to life were breath, water, and food. A man can live forty days without food   and about seven days without water. He cannot live seven minutes without breath.    John in bringing the story before us has led us over the ground in which we have seen Him meeting these essentials.    In the third chapter, when talking to Nicodemus, He spoke of breath.   The wind bloweth where it listeth. So the Spirit.   In chapter four He made the promise to the woman of water, living water, springing up.   Now here we reach food, abso- lutely essential to life.   We come along the line of illustration by that gradation-breath, water, food.</p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Necessarily therefore, having looked at the figure, we are bound</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3869.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3870.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">to face the essential teaching.   When Jesus said,   I am the Bread of life,” He was facing the hunger of man in his essential life, which is not physical, which is not mental, but which is spiritual.    Human life is essentially spiritual.   Do not take that word spiritual and make it mean good and holy and true.   It does not necessarily mean anything of the kind.  It refers to essential nature.   It may be false and untrue in its activities   but the essence of human Iife is spirit. To quote once more. When Paul was on Mars’ Hill he said God had made</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3871.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3872.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">of one every nation to dwell upon the face of the earth.

Man’s quest for  individuality,  personality  in  its  perfection  and  realization.  <span class="s105">S o </span>many of these eternal truths are sobbing and sighing through the writings of men, and the thinkings of men, without their understanding them.     the struggle we read about, all the attempts, all the high aspirations to make men fit.  What do we mean by being fit   Think it through, this quest of men for fitness, and the quest for man in his social relationships and international relationships.  First the quest for God, and then the search for man  and always, resultantly, the struggle against sin. We may change the word if we will. Struggle against failure, against imperfection   the consciousness that we have missed the mark   that is the word for sin in the New Testament. Humanity everywhere is missing the mark, and man everywhere is against it.  I am not talking about his folly, his foolishness, his wicked- ness, his rebellion. I am speaking of his hunger, and that hunger proves his quest for God, his search for man, and his struggle against sin.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3887.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3888.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3889.png"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">But hunger is not bread, though it declares the need for it.  There- fore hunger never becomes bread. The quest for God never means the finding of God.  The search for man never means the realization of the meaning of humanity. The struggle against sin never brings victory over it.  Hunger never becomes bread,  Unless bread be found, hunger issues in death, inevitably and invariably. Christ stood confronting all this, and He said,   I am the Bread of life,” a statement of august majesty     am the living bread,” I am the bread that has come down out of heaven for men.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3890.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3891.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3892.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Think for a moment, what does He do   Man is engaged in the quest for God, Christ reveals God.  Man is engaged in a search after man. He interprets man, and shows man what man really is. Man in rebellion against sin, failure, whatever he calls it, struggling <span class="s32">against </span>sin, He comes to save from sin, to break its power, wipe out its pollu- tion, and the profound reason why, He is the bread of life.  God is seen confronting humanity, and bringing within its reach that which shall satisfy all its hunger, end its quest in victory  answer its search in a perfect revelation, and deliver it from its paralysis and pollution in sin and power.  So Christ says,  I am the Bread of life.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3893.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">We are Christian man and women.

It has been applied in that way largely by certain theologians of whom we speak with respect, but from whom we profoundly differ. Our Lord was not referring to the Communion here at all, not even in <span class="s38">a </span>secondary sense. But seeing that a great deal of controversy has waged around this saying through the running years of theological consideration, at least it behoves us to consider this carefully, and</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 171pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FLESH AND BLOOD           <span><img width="18" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_3914.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">pray for the help of the Spirit to an understanding of what our Lord really meant.</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">So, taking our usual method, we consider first, what was the subject He intended to illustrate, for it was an illustration.

We have con- sidered that wonderful figure of speech,    the bread of life,” and that Christ claimed He was the Bread of life. This follows on directly. The bread of life  <span class="s25">is </span>the sustenance of life, the food of life   and Christ said He was that bread. Now, therefore, whatever He</p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">says about flesh and blood here, He said in close connection with that subject of bread, and must be concerned with the same theme, that, namely, of the sustenance of life.

We must get back into the atmo- sphere of the time. The separation of one from the other in this statement implies death.  If the blood be taken away from the flesh, that means death, always.   My flesh, My blood.” Mark well the inevitable <i>strangeness  </i>of this statement of Jesus to listening Jews and for us immediately it is evident that we cannot stay in the realm of the figure.  We cannot go any farther in that direction, and we must immediately seek the spiritual intention that Jesus had.  I am war- ranted in saying that because of what He said to these very disciples. When they said it was a hard saying, He told them,   It is the spirit that quickeneth  the flesh profiteth nothing  the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are life.”  The true sustenance of life is flesh.  He said that is   meat indeed,” that is truly food.  His blood is   drink indeed,” that is, truly drink.  Remembering the words He uttered are spirit, He is dealing with the essential nature of man, the essential hunger of man   with the essential necessity of man as to sustenance is true spiritual life.

The glorifica- tion of Jesus came when He was lifted on the Cross, out of the earth.</p><p style="padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">When He was lifted out of the earth, above it, He triumphed over it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4008.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4009.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="47" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4010.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">Now is the judgment of this world   <span class="s72">now </span>shall the prince of this world be cast out.

He that believeth on Me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.  But this spake He of the Spirit.”  We stay for a few moments with the figure itself, the flowing of the rivers.  It is an old story with which every Bible student is familiar.  It is important to recognize <span><img width="8" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4014.gif"/></span> was said on the last day of the feast of tabernacles. There is a good deal of local</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="35" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4015.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 129pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">concerning the story which it is helpful for us to see.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4016.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">The feast of tabernacles lasted for eight days, seven days and one other, completing the octave.  At the time of our Lord’s ministry they had superadded to the ritual observed in connection with that feast  and it was a very symbolic and suggestive thing they had done. Every day during that feast there was a procession of priests who, carrying some of the golden vessels on their shoulders empty, marched through the streets from the Temple, singing parts of the Great Hallel, that is, Psalms <span><img width="48" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4017.gif"/></span> Then they filled those vessels with water, most probably at the running brook of Kedron.  The procession then reformed with the vessels filled, and they marched back, still chanting parts of the Great Hallel, and there in the Temple courts in the presence <span class="s35">of the </span>assembled worshippers, they poured the water out of the golden vessels.</p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">What did they mean by it ? We have rabbinical interpretation. The carrying of the water was symbolical of two things. First, the fact that they had been in the wilderness, and God had miraculously supplied them with water over a period of years <span><img width="27" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4018.png"/></span> then: the fact that when they came into the land, they no longer needed the super- natural supply, because there were springs and rivers everywhere in the land.  The feast of tabernacles celebrated the entry into the land, and rejoiced that water had been provided in the wilderness, now no longer necessary. But, said the rabbis, the ritual signified more. It intimated the recognition of promises made to the people of a day that should come when there should be new fertilizing powers sweeping over the nation and the land, and for seven days they repeated this ceremony.</p><p style="padding-left: 110pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">Now on the eighth day there was no procession of priests. The</p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">absence, said the rabbis, signified first there was no need for the super- natural supply of water as they had had in the wilderness, but it was also intended to signify that the long hoped for promise of the new dispensation of fruitfulness and rededication had not dawned.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 193pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">RIVERS               <span><img width="23" height="20" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4019.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4020.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="12" height="2" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4021.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4022.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 61pt;text-indent: 16pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">On the last day, the great day, when there was no procession and carrying of the water, Jesus stood and He said,    If any man thirst, let him come to Me, and drink. He that believeth on Me     out of his inner life shall flow rivers of living water.”    This He spoke of the Spirit, and He employed this figure of living waters in that con- nection. He said,   As the scripture hath said.” A great deal has been <span class="s32">written </span>about that. Follow all through the Old Testament the figure of rivers.

These rivers proceeded forth, somehow, and in some way from God. We find, too, that the supreme Old Testament passage concerning the rivers is in Ezekiel, chapter forty-seven, that marvellous passage, out of which I take one sentence only.

But when He was proclaiming as a herald He stood      on this occasion, as the feast of tabernacles was drawing to its conclusion, and its ritual was ceasing, and all its suggestiveness was passing away, He stood.

I affirm my conviction that this is a true story, and that it took place here at this time.  Probably John did not write that story. Reading the Greek New Testament in Westcott and Hort’s text, this is put in at the end of the Gospel.  It was so important that it could not be left out altogether.  Nestle’s text has put it back here, but has put it in within brackets.  It might be proven that this little story was put in by Papias, that marvellous extra-illustrator, who later added stories of Jesus, and inserted them. But let that go.

This is a most fascinating theme. <span class="s35">In the old days at  </span>school they taught what they called Physics.    It had a threefold division, Sound, Light, and Heat.    The word here He used for light is common in the New Testament, as common as our word light is  the word <i>Phos </i>was common to the people who heard</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Jesus.  Our word light exactly conveys the meaning of that word He used,  <i>Phos </i>is derived from a word that means to shine, in order to make manifest.  <i>Phao </i>is the verb.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4110.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">What is light    Take it and examine it by spectrum analysis, and we discover at once light is a simple thing, and a vastly sublime thing. So the figure He made use of here I do not hesitate to say is very simple, so that every boy who perchance was in the temple courts, or youth near by, seeing the light all about them in the early morning, would understand and see. But examine it. Some say that light consists of seven primary colours, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.  Strictly, however, there are only three primary colours, red, blue, and yellow. All the others result from some combination of red, blue, and yellow.   I remember the thrill that came to me as a boy with my first box of paints. I discovered one day, quite by <span><img width="81" height="15" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4111.gif"/></span> if I took a bit of beautiful blue and glorious yellow, I had the most radiant green.

To go back earlier than that, the thinkers were under the mastery of Sir Isaac Newton. He had said that light was minute particles projected at great velocity from luminous bodies    that is that light was caused by the projection into the ether by a vast velocity, terrific force of corpuscles or atoms from the sun and stars. Men believed that for a long time.   But at the beginning of the nineteenth century they discovered that the true explanation is that light is undulation.</p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That is to say, it is caused by waves, in an all pervading elastic medium, and the colour depends upon the length of rays.    Red is the longest. I have been fascinated in the study of this. Light is a wondrous thing.</p><p style="padding-left: 103pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Then I sought for some definition of light, and I found two.   Light</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4115.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">has been defined by one of the great masters as    radiant energy.” The undulatory waves are there, beating through the ether; but it is radiant, and it is energy.   I found something simpler still, and we</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4116.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">see the accuracy of this through what lies behind it.   Light <span class="s60">is  </span>the agent by which objects are rendered visible.”   Everybody knows that. Light is energy, and its sublimity is discovered.   Movement all round the world. Sound, tone is created when the movement is so subtle that sight could not see or grasp it.   But it is the same thing.   In a picture gallery we see the tone of that picture.   We say, we like the tone of that organ.  The tone of the picture and the tone of the music.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4117.gif"/></span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: left;">It is the same  <span class="p">thing-undulation.   The mystery and the marvel of it, but the simplicity of it.   I like the last statement,   the agent by</span></p><p style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: left;">which objects are rendered visible.” Wherever we see them there is visibility, and always beauty.   Visibility, we see it, but colour is beauty in light. The Son of God never uttered a more marvellous word than when He said, in the midst of all the prevailing darkness,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4118.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4119.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 86pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: left;">I am the light of the world.”   What infinite music of eternal vibra- tion, in order to revelation and visibility and beauty, was contained in His claim,  I am the light of the world.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4120.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4121.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4122.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">We have still got our Bible, and I was glad to get back to it from all these other sayings and readings.

It is used of the whole framework of the universe, the cosmos   and it is sometimes used of man, all men, the sum totality of humanity. It is sometimes used of the way in which man orders his life.   The root idea is order, the cosmos is the order. Christ says,   I am the light.”   I am the light of,” that is, I am the light for, I am the light in the midst of the cosmos.   Use the word as you will, the word cosmos   I am the light in the midst of the universe, with all its far-flung distances.   I am the light in the sum totality of humanity.

In the background we have the story of His giving of sight to a man born blind.  Everything  grew out of that.  It is the only record we have of Jesus dealing with what we call now congenital disease, a man born blind.  We remember the story.  When He had given that man his sight, it aroused a great deal of interest and attention among the people, and they were very much puzzled by it. What did they do   Arrested, perplexed, they took this man to the constituted religious authorities.  The Hebrew back- ground of authority is seen in this story.  The Pharisees were those who, as Jesus said upon another occasion, sat in Moses’ seat. They were the interpreters of the law  but they had become far more than that.  They had become those who claimed full and final authority to interpret the order of life.

Do not imagine they were in some room of the temple courts, and that they went to the door and put him out.  It is far more than  that.  They pronounced upon him the word of excommunication. They put him out of the order in which they themselves officiated. They resented any interference.  As we look back, we see a strange thing happen.  The man born blind, who has received his sight,-and he is quite certain of that,-who is in controversy with these very rulers, is approaching a larger understanding of the fact of Jesus Himself.

The very word translated fold implies that, the sweeping wind, not a roof, but an enclosing wall.  The sheep did not climb the walls.  In that country there was only one entry, one door, never two.  The door-apparent paradox-was merely an opening in the wall or palisade.  It was never a gateway in those Eastern folds, never a door on hinges.    was merely an opening.

I am the door of the sheep.”  We come to the subject of the shepherd in our next study.  But what does all this mean ?  Keep in mind the surroundings, the blind man excom- municated, and admitted, put outside the ancient order, but brought into close fellowship with Jesus. What did He do that day ? His parable illustrates what He did.  First we see in that act, perhaps the first of its kind in the ministry of Jesus, His supersedure of a failing religious order. That order had excommunicated the man. What did Jesus do ? Christ excommunicated the whole order. He put it outside the realm of authority.  That is what He meant when He said,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4235.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: justify;">All that came before Me are thieves and robbers.”  That verse seems to have troubled some people.  He was not referring to the prophets and Moses.  He was referring to those who were claiming that final authority  that  these  men  claimed,  when  they  excommunicated  the man. In that sense in which they had claimed authority they were only thieves and robbers.  He claimed to be the door, the Superseder of a failing order.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4236.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">My mind travels away to that parenthesis in the letter to the Hebrews, when the writer said   The law made nothing perfect.” There the reference was not to the law of God merely, but to the whole economy supposedly based upon the law of God.  But it had perfected nothing.  All it had done in the case of this man was to put him outside, excommunicate  him.  Jesus once said, addressing these very rulers,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4237.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4238.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4239.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 11pt;text-align: left;">Woe unto you lawyers  for ye took away the key of knowledge ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.”  They supposed they were putting a man outside the pale of religion.

Go back and look at that blind man face to face with Christ.   Dost thou believe on the Son of God    Some MSS. render that   Son of man.”  Whichever rendering is accepted makes no difference at all  for  the Son of man   was the Lord’s favourite  description  of  Himself.  If He here called Himself the Son of man it does not devalue the thought.  Dost thou believe in Me ? Yet the title had been used, whether Son of man or Son of God.  And the man said, Who is He, that I may believe ?  Let us try to put our- selves into the soul of the blind man.  For the first time he had been able to see, to look upon the shimmer of the waters of Galilee, had seen his mother’s face, and was able to see this Being, and He says, Thou hast seen Him, and I am He.  At once the man’s soul went over to Him in glad surrender,  Lord, I believe,” and he offered Him worship. That is how he went into the fold.  That is how every man enters the fold. That is how every human being enters, face to face with Christ Who challenges them. He does not ask us if we believe the Apostles’ Creed.  He does not ask if we have accepted this view or the other, but, Who am I ?  Do you believe in Me   Yes, I believe and, believing, I worship.  So the fold is entered.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4252.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4253.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="41" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4254.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: right;">The overwhelming revelation is that Christ is the way of entrance to the fold of the Kingdom of God, with all its privileges and all its responsibilities.  If other systems professedly having all authority cast men outside, He confronts them and says, Here is the door, here is the way. All this harmonizes with what He said to the disciples a little later on.   I am the way, and the truth, and the life  no one unto the Father but by Me.” The fold is the place of the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="85" height="18" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4255.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4256.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Kingship of God found, yielded to,           and the way in is Christ.

The man grew in understanding himself as he talked to them, until they were angry with him  and as John tells us, they cast him out, which meant that they put him out, not of the temple precincts, but they excommuni- cated him. They put him outside the covenant, and outside the established order over which for the time being they were in authority. Whether their exercise of authority was good or not we are not dis- cussing. We know it was not. When the Lord knew they had cast him out, He found him and there passed between this man and Jesus that little conversation, and He asked, in effect, Do you believe in Me   In that moment Jesus received him to Himself. It was then He said,  I am the door,” and by that figure of speech He claimed that He was the way of entry into a new order entirely.  That may be put in  another  way.  They  had  excommunicated  the  man,  and  Jesus excommunicated them. He did so on subsequent occasions more definitely and specifically, when He said the Kingdom of God should be taken away from them. By that action He was putting Himself in the place of authority, and He was receiving this man into the entirely new order that He was in the world to set up.  Then He said,   I am the door.”  By that He claimed that He was the way of entry to that new order, that men should enter into it through Him, as this man had done, when he had submitted to Him in belief, and worshipped Him in person.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4274.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">We now come to the second thing.

The fold is an enclosure.  The flock is those who are       It is important to make that distinction. He did not say there should be one fold and one shepherd, but one flock. There may be many folds, just as in that Eastern country.  The shep- herd in that land may own two or three dozen sheep, and they can be folded in many folds, but it is one flock.  The unity was not created</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4278.gif"/></span>   <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">by the fold, but by the nature of the sheep, and their relationship to the shepherd.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="34" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4279.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4280.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">The shepherd was the one not only able to take charge of the flock. This is an Eastern picture, different from anything we know in this country. The sheep know his voice.  That is literally true of Eastern shepherds.  If a stranger came along, the sheep     shrink back they know their shepherd’s voice, and follow when he calls.  He was in charge of them, and it was his work to lead them out of the fold to pasturage, in order to the sustenance of their life.  Of course it was also his work to defend them against wolves, or any enemies.  That was the Eastern shepherd.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4281.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">But when our Lord used this figure, I think there can be no doubt that He was employing the figure in one way. The shepherd was always the symbol of the king.  It was Homer who once said,  All kings are shepherds of their people.”  It was a great idealistic word.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4282.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4283.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 90pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: right;">As we look down human history we may be inclined to say, amending that statement, All kings should be shepherds. God’s kings were always shepherds, and the shepherd was the king.  I quote a verse oft quoted.  Our Lord was talking to His disciples one day, and said to them,   Fear not, little flock  for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.”  I can imagine a purely literary critic coming to that sentence in some booklet published to-morrow, who might indulge  in  pleasantries.  He might say, The writer now broke down in his employment of his figures.  He first suggests the flock of sheep,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4284.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4285.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4286.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 10pt;text-align: right;">Fear not, little flock.”  Then forgetting that, he went off to the idea of the family,   It is your Father’s good pleasure <span><img width="13" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4287.png"/></span> and before he finished, he had forgotten that figure also, and used the figure of a nation,  to give you the Kingdom.”  We know perfectly well, however, that though the figures merge they do not mix.  Those are the three elements that constitute Kingship ideally in all that Eastern country, and ought to everywhere. The king should be the shepherd of his flock, the father of his family, the one in authority over his nation. When our Lord said quietly, but with august majesty and dignity,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4288.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4289.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 10pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">I am the good Shepherd,” all those figures, all those implications of the figure of the shepherd and the flock, unquestionably merge in His claim,  I am the good Shepherd.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4290.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4291.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4292.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">We come now to the supreme matter.  What was the teaching, the thing revealed   What did Jesus claim when He said that  Two things, absolute authority and constant care in and over the new order that He was in the world to establish.  God had established the order of the Hebrew people but they had broken down.  Need that be argued or even illustrated ?  Is there anything more ghastly than the failure of the Hebrew people from the beginning to the end ?  They were always failing, and they never failed more disastrously than when they wanted a king  like the nations.”  In that act, as God said to Samuel, they had rejected Him from being King.  It had gone on through the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 158pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE GOOD SHEPHERD          <span><img width="19" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4293.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4294.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4295.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: left;">ages, and the  last thing the Hebrew people did to prove their ultimate and appalling catastrophic folly and sin was to crucify the Son of God. So God was superseding the order definitely established   as the writer of the letter to the Hebrews said, the law   made nothing perfect.” It broke down and failed, and its failure was manifested in that one incident.  When those men in authority put this man out, they revealed their failure.  Then Jesus took him in, and admitted him to the new order to which He was the door.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4296.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: left;">Now He is in authority.

He said,   Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold  them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice, and they shall become one flock, one Shepherd.”  Not one fold necessarily, but one flock.  It is interesting to remember how in the next chapter (xi.), we have the striking story of Caiaphas, the clever and astute politician.  When these enemies of Christ, these men exercising authority in a wrong way, were plotting as to what they should do with Him, Caiaphas rose after their discussion, and introduced his subject by that excellent formula, if one wants to be heard,  Ye know nothing at all.” He said this,   It is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.”  Then follows this remarkable little passage of interpretation.   Now this he said not of himself  but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation  and not for the nation only, but that He might gather together into one the children of God that are scattered  abroad.”   Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice  and they shall become one <span><img width="29" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4326.gif"/></span> one Shepherd.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4327.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 92pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: right;">Again, what was the deep secret of His authority, the secret of His care, the secret of His laying down of His life for the sheep ?

In this story we see Him in the presence of death on the physical level, that is, the separation of the spirit and body.  Death in the spiritual level is the separation of the soul from God.

He knew the fact as they saw it.  He knew the fact as it was recurring around Him in all the time of His public ministry.  He knew the fact as these men saw it, as Martha and Mary saw it in the case of Lazarus but in His first reference to it He did not use either of these words for death.

He saw death as they saw it, and consequently when they did not understand Him, He said the plain thing, He is dead, emphasizing it in the word He used, completely dead, actually dead. The body that has been put <i>in </i>the sepulchre is lifeless  he is dead.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4371.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4372.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4373.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4374.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 88pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">But before we can approach or understand His figure of speech, we have to take the whole story.  If He saw the fact of death as they saw it, He knew the fact of death as they did not know it.  Here we are in the presence of that outlook of Jesus which is so manifest in all the story of His life  that whereas He saw the near, that which was right under their eyes, He always saw more. He never looked upon life as complete, as it could be viewed at the moment under the circumstances. He saw more. He saw through   and therefore He said, Lazarus is sleeping.  They said, He will do well  he will recover. No, He said, he is dead, as you mean death  but I see more than you do. Those are the circumstances, and it was to illustrate that, that He used this figure of speech,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4375.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">Now take the figure and look at it simply. What is sleep   It is not cessation of being even on the human level.  When we go to sleep it does not mean our being has ceased in sleep.  What is it therefore ? Unconsciousness of all things around.  I am not going into the subject of dreams, those strange experiences that we all have.  I am dealing with normal and proper sleep, when we have eaten the sort of supper</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4376.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="32" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4377.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 87pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">we ought to eat  We are unconscious of everything.

There it is, completely unconscious of surrounding things.  That is the figure our Lord used, and therefore we have come rightly and very beautifully to associate the idea of sleep with repose. The words are recurring   Nature’s sweet restorer, balmy sleep.”  That is what those men with Jesus thought when they said, if Lazarus was asleep, he would recover. If a man has been ill, and has really gone to sleep, he will recover, he will be saved  literally that is what they said.  The danger is past, for he is sleeping.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4381.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Let us notice another thing in passing.  This figure that our Lord made use of was not a new one for death.  Sleep as the image of death is common in literature from its dawn.  Pagan writers used it as well as those of the Hebrew people. Westcott says the image of sleep for death is very common in all Rabbinic writings.  That is the image our Lord took up. Yes, Lazarus was dead. He spoke plainly.

That is what they saw, and that is all they saw.  But Jesus said, That is not all. As a matter of fact it is not the supreme fact.  He is dead, he has lost the consciousness of all the things that are around him, his sisters and friends, and everything else. He is dead  but he is not dead in the full and deep sense of the word.  He saw the dead body, but He saw the man   and the man was not in the sepulchre as He saw him.  So that He said, So far as this side is concerned, so far as you are concerned, he is dead  but so far as he is concerned, and the things of this side, he is unconscious, he knows nothing about them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4387.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: justify;">We might indulge in many speculations, which are not profitable.

Lazarus heard and struggled into an upright position in his grave-clothes, as would be quite possible if they, as they certainly did, adopted the Egyptian method of winding him.    He could and did get up, and then Jesus said,   Loose him, and let him go.”   The little girl, not yet wrapped in her grave-clothes, but lying there, she heard His voice, and she sat up, and opened her eyes.   The young man was able to struggle up on his bier, possibly helped from it, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4402.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">So that if we speak of death as sleep we must recognize that the only One Who can wake out of sleep is our Lord Himself, the only One Who can bring back into consciousness those fallen on sleep.

That may be difficult to see, except by general deduction and con- sideration. I venture therefore to take that general consideration, and make a deduction.   These were Greeks, Hellenes.   The word marks</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="52" height="13" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4447.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 89pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">them as to race and nationality.   If they were Greeks, not Hellenistic Jews, they were Greek proselytes to the Jewish faith, because John distinctly tells us they had come up to worship at the feast. We know full well that there were at that time very many who, from other nations and other peoples and races and religions, turned towards the Hebrew religion, and became proselytes of the gate,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 169pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A GRAIN OF WHEAT          <span><img width="26" height="18" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4448.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">accepting Jewish ritual and the Jewish law, and the Jewish view of God.  There is no doubt these Greeks were of that number, and they had come up to worship at the feast.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4449.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4450.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: left;">What made them ask to see Jesus ?  The first self-evident answer is, He was being talked about.  Men everywhere were talking about Him. The thronging crowds gathering to the feast were all, sooner or later, talking about Him.  His fame had gone out everywhere, and the things He had been saying were well known.  Many had received what He had said, and had been obedient, and were enrolled among the number of His disciples, who were more than twelve.  After His resurrection, five hundred brethren went up to Galilee <i>to </i>meet Him and there were multitudes who had been so influenced. Everyone knew something about Jesus   and these Greeks, coming up to the feast, would hear about Him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4451.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4452.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 20pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">Now we come to the point where we cannot be definitely dogmatic. It may be their coming was one of curiosity.  They had heard about this  wonderful  Teacher,  about  the  strange  supernatural  things  He had done, of healing all manner of disease, and cleansing the lepers, and all the wonders of His work.  They may have thought they would like to look at Him, and to have a conversation with Him.  That may all be true  but the whole method of the answer of Jesus makes me believe there was something far more profound in it than that.  I see men who had turned from paganism to God, in the Hebrew religion. That is the first thing. There is no doubt about that. Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue in the religions in which they had been brought up, all the multiplied religions of the land to which they belonged. These Greeks, for very weariness of heart and soul, had gone to the Hebrew religion with its one God, the living God.  Here they were, at the feast, keeping the law and observing the ritual, they had come up with the multitudes to worship. I believe they had become not merely disappointed with their pagan religion, but dis- illusioned in the matter of Judaism. These men seeking after God, seeking after the truth, longing to find it, had turned from idols to the living God. Then they heard about a Teacher, and they felt there was something in what they had heard, something different, something higher, something nobler. They were finding out Judaism was not satisfying the deepest hunger of their souls.  So they found their way to the place where Jesus was that day with His disciples all round about Him   and got hold of that delightful man, Philip, who Elvet Lewis long ago said was a man always on the edge of the crowd, never obtrusive, but ready to lead others to his Master.  It may be these Greeks were attracted to him because he bore a Greek name. But they proffered their request, and said, Sir, we want to see Jesus. What a world of meaning there was in that.  I think they were honest and sincere.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 81pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So the human desire lay at the back of what Jesus said. The</p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">294   <span class="p">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUR LORD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4453.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: justify;">desire was shared by His disciples.  They were a little hesitant about it.  They held a splendid committee meeting, splendid <span class="s39">because it only </span>consisted of two, that is, Philip and Andrew. They got together. Mark the psychology of this.  Philip knew that something was about to happen.  He had been with the disciples during these six months in which Jesus had been telling them distinctly that He was going to die.  At any rate Philip knew that his Master was occupied with great thinking and great sorrow   and therefore he wondered whether he ought to trouble Him.  So he went to Andrew.  We are not told of any discussion.  It was a good committee meeting, in which they did not waste any time.  They both went to Jesus and told Him of the request. I think they were anxious that these Greeks should see Him, men of another religion and nation to see their Lord and Master. They wanted them to hear Him because they were of a wider realm.  There is human desire on the part of the enquiring Greeks, and on the part of the disciples. To that Jesus answered, and the figure of speech He used was intended to illuminate and illustrate what He said in reply to that enquiry and request of the Greeks.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4454.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4455.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="44" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4456.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: right;">What then made Him say what He said   Notice the first thing He said,  The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.” There we have a full stop.

I hold that is utterly wrong, and there is no warrant for it.  Go back over the Gospel, and notice the repeated references to the   hour.”  The first reference is when He was talking to His mother Mary at      She had come to Him, hoping that He would work a wonder by which His glory would be revealed, and He said, the hour had not come.  What did He mean then  That He would not perform the miracle   No, for immediately He did what she had asked. He told her that His glory would not be seen through the wonder of the miracle He worked, for His hour was not yet come. That hour was referred to again and again, but always as postponed. When the Greeks came and said, We want to see Jesus  He said, The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified  verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone.”  That is the answer.

But if that grain of wheat is planted, and it dies, and we watch, we shall see first the blade, and then the ear, and then the full corn in the ear.

All the public teaching was over, and the works wrought in the sight of the multitudes had ceased.  He had gathered around Him that first little band whom He had chosen to be with Him, and that He might send forth in His name. Through these chapters (xiii.-xvii.) there was no stranger there.  Jesus was alone with His own.  There were thirteen men there  our Lord Himself, and twelve others.  Very soon the number was reduced.  As a matter of fact, this very parabolic action led to the exclusion of Judas.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4526.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 14pt;text-align: justify;">We give attention then to the action in itself, and proceed first to ask, What was our Lord intending to illustrate in His action on this memorable  occasion   Then we will examine the figure revealed in the action, and which He thus employed for teaching His own.

That mind is remarkably revealed in the opening words of the chapter,   Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing.” That is repeated in verse three,   Jesus knowing.”  We are told of two things, all He did, and all He said on this occasion.

I am not concerned with what follows, although it is important. John here emphasizes the consciousness of Christ at the time.  That was the supreme thing, the first thing, that He knew that His hour was come.  What hour   That He should depart out of this world unto the Father.” <span class="s39">The con- </span>sciousness of Christ is marvellously revealed to us, and the merging in it of His knowledge of all that lay before Him, all the terror that was in front of Him, and yet the consciousness of triumph through the terror. He knew His hour was come when the Greeks came. He then said  The hour is come that the Son of man should be <span><img width="29" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4535.gif"/></span><span class="s33"> </span>fied.”  Now the hour was come,  The Greeks could only see Him as He went down into death, and came out again in resurrection power, as the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies.  Now, He knew that the hour was come that He should depart out of the world.  With all reverence, by way of interpretation, He knew how He was to depart out of the world.  He had been telling His disciples for six months over and over again of the method of His going.  They, dear souls, had been frightened.  Now He knew that the hour had come, and He knew the method of it,  He knew the issue of it.  Yes, He was departing <span class="s39">out of </span>the world, but where was He going ?  To the Father, and the note of</p><p style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">perfect assurance and victory is there.

He knew that   the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He came forth from God, and goeth unto God.”  There was the consciousness that His hour was come, and there was the certain consciousness of His own authority, which He had received from His Father.    All things were delivered into His hands.” We look at Him, and as we look we wonder.  All things   Just beyond is the Cross, when He was delivered into the hands of sinful men,  That is only the surface outlook.  All things were delivered into His hands, and He knew that  and He knew that He had come from God, and was going to God.  So the lights and glories as of the Urim and Thummim on the breastplate of the priest in the olden days flash through this the mind of Christ.  That is the background.  But what else is here ? We have the background of the disciples, those who were round about Him, and of all that had been happening amongst them during the previous six months to which we have referred already.  Ponder  again carefully those last six months, from       Philippi, and Peter’s confession and the Cross.  Do not forget He had never explicitly told them He was going to the Cross till then  but from that moment there was a feeling of estrangement. They could not understand. I am not criticizing them.  We should not have understood  and they did not.  We find over and over again our Lord told them about His Cross, took them aside to tell them, and to tell them carefully in detail</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 157pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE WASHING OF FEET          <span><img width="19" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4546.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4547.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4548.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="25" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4549.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4550.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 1pt;text-align: left;">and in every case we find these two startling facts, that He never told them about His Cross but that He also mentioned His resurrection and also that in every case, immediately after His emphasizing of His Cross, they were disputing, quarrelling as to who was the greatest. There they were, men thinking about their own pre-eminence, and their own positions of power   and there is a sense in which that was permissible, and yet it was entirely self-centred.   Who is the greatest In that Kingdom who shall have the position of power, and two men thought they ought to have it, and got their mother to speak for them. It is a way mothers have sometimes    When they had done this, the ten were angry with them for having done it, and the reason was the ten were angry because they wanted the position themselves. That is not being unkind to them. There is the background. Jesus knew what was in their hearts, and by that symbolic action, that parabolic action, the subject illustrated was first the heart of the Lord Himself, that those men might see Him by a simple act, yet so sublime, that</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="31" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4551.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">it holds us in its      to-day.

Jesus said to Peter, He that is bathed only needs to wash his feet   and in a moment the Eastern habits are revealed. To bathe meant complete cleansing, and the picture behind this is that of a man having been to the baths, and completely bathed, taking his way home through the dust of the high- way, contracting dust upon his feet, and when he reaches home he will cleanse his feet from defilement contracted after he has bathed.    That is an Eastern figure, and all would be familiar with it as Jesus said,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4569.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4570.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 66pt;text-indent: 8pt;text-align: left;">He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet.” After the complete cleansing of the bath, that does not need to be repeated</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="11" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4571.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">but he does need to be cleansed from any defilement    he walks by the way.

The action must have been very arresting to those men, because it must have been something entirely unusual.   To wash the feet of these men sitting round the board was a most unusual procedure. Notice the statement of verse two, which is open to different meanings, two al- ternatives   during supper.”  In verse four we are told, knowing these things, He   riseth from supper, and layeth aside His garments.” What He did, He did then,   He riseth from supper.”   The alternative is that during the meal He did this   or at the close He did it, and not at first.  It is difficult for the Western mind to see the unusualness of this action.  This was not the close of a journey, when they constantly brought water to wash away the dust of the highway. There were constant ceremonial washings of the feet before the meal.    Here it was not at the close of a journey, or specifically before a meal.   It was either during a meal or at its close. This is important.    He suddenly arose, and laying aside His garments, He took a towel and girded Himself, poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet.    The particular description of that unusual procedure would immediately arrest their special attention.   What could it mean that the One Who was practically the Host, suddenly in the midst of the meal, or when</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4578.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 104pt;text-indent: -1pt;text-align: left;">it was over, did what men usually did before a meal, or after a journey</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4579.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4580.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4581.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">What was He doing    He said to them, Do you know what I have done  They did not understand. Then He explained, and we see to the heart of it. There was the supreme and wonderful revelation of His heart to those men.   Two were there, Judas and Jesus, and the heart of Judas was Satan inspired by hatred, as the result of Satanic action, a determination to betray.    In the heart of Jesus there was the passion to serve, and to serve in self-emptying action. Watch Him. He riseth, He girdeth Himself, He washeth. What is that Girding meant far more in the East. The towel was the badge of</p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">slavery.  It was the slave who was girded about the loins with a towel of homespun or common material.   Jesus, taking a towel, laying aside His garments, girded Himself, drew it around Him, and took the attitude of a slave, and did the slave’s work. Taking a basin, and pouring water, He carried the basin and knelt in the attitude of a slave.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4582.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Whether Peter was the first, I will not argue   but supposing he was,</p><p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">He knelt down at Peter’s feet, and began, as a slave would do, to wash</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4583.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4584.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="20" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4585.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the feet of the disciples.

It was the shining of His glory.   There is the grace, but there is also the glory.   That knotted towel was the badge of slavery  but here is the remarkable fact that the knotted garment was also the insignia of princes    with the very same method of fasten- ing and tying.   The difference was in material   for the slave a rough homespun cloth   for princes purple or gold. I think back through the years  <span class="s39">and </span>John saw in that girdle not only the badge of slavery, but the girdle of kingship.   We do not forget when he was in Patmos, and he had a vision of this Self-same One in all His glory, in that marvellous description he has given, among other things he wrote,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4596.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 8pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">girt about at the breasts with a golden girdle.”    Yes, he saw that in Patmos, and looking back he saw the sackcloth of the slave trans- muted into the glory and purple of sovereignty.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="7" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4597.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 71pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">No, said Jesus, you do not understand now, but you will some day.

If I then, the Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye ought also to wash one another’s feet.”   What does it mean    He knew that in the walk of those who were cleansed by the bathing there would be the contraction of defilement    and they would need the washing of the feet. He said, You have seen Me do it  <span class="s113">; you </span>ought also to be ready to do it for each other.   Paul was writing to the Galatian Christians and he said this (vi.  <span class="s12">I</span><span class="s13">),  </span>Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in a spirit</p><p style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of meekness, Iest thou also be tempted.”   What our Lord was saying to His fellow-disciples was, I know the way, all along this pilgrimage cleansed men will contract defilement.   When your brother does, your business is not to emphasize the defilement, not to turn to your brother</p><p style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the cold shoulder of pride and indifference. Your business is to attempt to wash his feet, to restore such an one, as Paul says, in the spirit of meekness.

We saw that when dealing with the washing of the disciples’ feet. Again it is important here. We must bear in mind that strangely perplexing hour for the disciples. Evidence of it comes out in the things they said to Him when He told them He was going.  They could not understand   Whither I go, ye cannot come.”  We are familiar with what happened.  Peter said, Where art Thou going   Thomas said, We do not know where Thou art going, how can we know the way   Philip said,   Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.”  Jude said,   What is come to pass that Thou wilt manifest Thyself unto us, and not unto the world ?

Peter knew that Jesus was going to death.  He had been told that again and again for six months,  Now they knew perfectly well His enemies were waiting for Him, and that He was going to death.  When Peter said, Where are You going    Whither goest Thou ?  he was peering out into the unknown mysterious spaces.

They all lived </span>in houses.  The dwelling-place is the simple meaning of it.  He said in the house of My Father there are many mansions.   Mansions.” The word has unfortunate connotations.  Some people think the house is a villa residence.  Some people have sung about the mansions over yonder.  What is this word  mansions  ?  It is the word     which means simply an abode. The verb     is a common word in the New Testament  but the word mone is not, only occurring here and in <span class="s72">one </span>other place, in verse twenty-three  both times from the lips of Jesus.    In My Father’s house are many <span class="s72">mansions </span><span><img width="23" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4659.png"/></span> We will come     and make Our <span class="s72">abode </span>with him.” So we have a double idea here, and we see at once that the term  house   is inclusive.  I prefer to use for that the word   dwelling-place,” and for the word mansions,”   abiding-places.”  That may not help us very much.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4660.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4661.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4662.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 98pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Yet I would read it in that way.

Twice in the course of the ministry of our Lord He made use of that phrase,  My Father’s house.”  The first is in the second chapter of this Gospel.  When He was cleansing the Temple, He said   My Father’s house,” There He was referring to the temple. He said it here,   In My Father’s house are many man- sions.”  The first figure is that of the temple itself.  He referred to the temple as “the house of God” on other occasions.  He called it the house in God in Matthew (xii. 4).  He spoke of it as His own house, assuming the place of God.  At the terrible end He referred to the temple not as My Father’s house, or My house, but   your house is left unto you desolate.”  His references were all to the temple.</p><p style="padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">Let us be content to spend time with the simplicities of this.  Go back and look at the temple.  He was familiar with it, and often went into it.  We have accounts of His having been in three parts of the temple. At the feast of tabernacles He was in the treasury. At the feast of dedication He was in Solomon’s porch.  In the case of the widow He was over against the treasury, sitting there.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4669.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">THE FATHER’S HOUSE AND MANY  <span class="s54">MANSIONS</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4670.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 59pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: left;">What was the temple like   It has often been described as it existed  then.

There are varied opinions, but two principal ones. Some believe that He took them from the upper room through the streets and into the temple.  Passover was at hand, and at that time the great beautiful gates of the temple were left open all night that pilgrims might pass in and out.  If He did take them there, as they passed through that gate they would see with the light of the Passover moon quite likely shining upon it, the national emblem. What was it  The golden vine. It has been suggested that He spoke by the side of those gates,  I am the vine, the true.”  I do not know person- ally, I think it is poetically beautiful.

His disciples were gathered round Him, perplexed, and fearful of the future without Him. He had made it perfectly evident to them, and they knew it was true, because of the circumstances pointing to it, that they would not have Him with them much longer.  He was going away, and Peter was troubled.  That was the atmosphere  but He had just made them a remarkable promise.  He had said to them,   I will not leave you desolate.”  I like to translate that literally,  I will not leave you orphans, I come unto you.” They had heard Him say that. He was going, and yet He had told them He would not leave them orphans, or desolate, alone, that He would come to them.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4755.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4756.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: right;">Then He showed them how He would come. He would send Another Comforter.”  He would send the Holy Spirit, to use the transliteration, the Paraclete, One called to the side of another. We have rendered it in two ways, Comforter and Advocate. He is my Comforter, He disannuls my orphanage  but He is also my Advocate, keeping in mind the things He spoke, keeping me alive to their con- <span class="s57">sciousness, making His presence a real presence.    </span>He had told the</p><p style="padding-left: 65pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">disciples that.</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Now to look at the figure He used, in order to interpret the new relationship with Himself which would be established by the way of the coming of the Comforter, the Advocate, the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit.  The vine illustrates the result of that new life into which they were to enter, the new experience they were going to have, of a new relationship with Himself.  Such then was the subject illustrated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4757.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4758.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4759.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4760.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4761.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="3" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4762.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="3" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4763.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">Look at the figure of the vine. We cannot go far wrong if we stay in the realm of the material vine that bears grapes.

They are exactly the same words in the Greek, but they are arranged thus. Some Greek scholars may think it is Greek idiom, but I think it is more in this case.

He borrowed it, and without any hesitation I say that He borrowed it from the Old Testament. We find the figure of the vine employed in the Book of Psalms. That is the first occurrence (Psalm 80).

They are two. Take two words    abide,” and   ask.”  Perhaps one may think that is a curious  combination.  Every branch in any vine must abide, but what about  asking   No, the figure is perfect. Go and look at a vine, whether here or in the East.  Get close to it, and listen.  You cannot hear anything, but if you could, you would see in every branch move- ment, a movement of life pressing along, pressing along, towards the grapes.  Every branch is not only pressing upward, and growing off the main stem  it is praying   every branch is dependent for sap, life element for maintenance to carry it out, to carry it forward, and press it out into fruit bearing.  So Jesus said, If you abide, you can demand, you can ask whatever you are inclined to-a most amazing thing ever said about prayer is that statement. But the condition is that we abide. If we abide there, it is His life in us, our life is for evermore demanding more and more, to press it out to that fruit that God expects, and for which the world is waiting.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="4" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4817.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4818.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 94%;text-align: left;">There is no need to say a great deal about abiding.

We must remember the background of the  occasion.  He was going, and they were sore troubled by reason of that fact  and because they knew He was going as He had told them by the pathway of suffering and death.  But their supreme trouble was not so much that of the method of His going, dark as that must have appeared to them  but the fact He was going at all, that He was leaving them.  He had been with them for three and a half years in very close converse, and He was going from them. Immediately preceding the use of this figure He had given them the allegory of the vine, and His statement in verse sixteen was the concluding sentence of that section of the allegory.   A little while, and ye behold Me no more  and again a little while, and ye shall see Me.”  That has no reference to the second advent.  He was not referring to His second advent then. He was referring to the coming of the Holy Spirit, through Whom they would see Him as they had never seen Him before, and would remember all that He had told them.  In the course of that conversation He had declared to them He would not leave them orphans, desolate  that He would come to them, when He, the Paraclete, should come, Whose office it should be to take of those things of the Christ, and reveal Him to them  and interpret all He had said to them, and make Him, the Christ, the consciousness of these men, as they had never known Him before.</p><p style="padding-left: 97pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">If anyone is looking for the experience of the Holy Ghost, they are looking for something the Bible has never promised.

He was recognizing their sorrows. He was, moreover, declaring that sorrows to them would be inevitable, as He was a Man of sorrows, and they were inevitable to Him.  But He was intending to reveal by that illustration the meaning of those sorrows, and the issue of them.  There they were, filled with sorrow, and their sorrow would become yet more profound, would become deeper.  They would go forth presently, when He was absent from sight, and especially after He had come to them again, and made Himself a reality as they had never known Him before, they would go out by the way of sorrows. He was speaking to them, He was speaking to His Church, He was speaking to us, of the nature of those sorrows. Then He used this figure.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4868.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4869.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4870.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="13" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4871.gif"/></span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 70pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 85%;text-align: justify;">Let us reverently take the figure He employed. It is the figure of motherhood, in its ultimate function. We read here,  A woman when she is in travail.”  That should be a definite article, not the indefinite, as we describe the difference between articles.   <span class="s25">The </span>woman.”  As a matter of fact He made use all through of what we call the generic article,  <span class="s25">The </span>woman.”  He is using the figure of mother- hood in the ultimate functioning thereof.  He is using as a figure the travail of a woman, when she goes down under the whelming floods into darkness and agony, and faces death. No profounder figure of sorrow could be employed than that. Do not forget   wars are fought out at last on the heart of womanhood, and the sorrows of the world are consecrated in motherhood.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: 14pt;line-height: 86%;text-align: justify;">To me it is a most arresting fact demanding most reverent con- sideration that the very last time He is recorded to have used an illustration, He adopted this figure. I never read it without feeling somehow He had in mind the Virgin Mother.  He was recognizing the fact that His very existence on the earthly plane, in the marvel and economy of the will of God, was due to birth-pangs borne by a woman. I think He knew, too, perfectly well that if Mary, His Mother, had passed through that baptism of agony and death, she had come out into the joy and sunlight, when the Man Child was born into the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4872.gif"/></span></p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 69pt;text-indent: -17pt;line-height: 85%;text-align: justify;">.  So <span class="s15">the figure recognizes a process of sorrow and anguish, the issue of which is deliverance and life and joy.  Do not forget the condition of these men, and what lay before them, and their understanding of it. It was the recognition of process and anguish, into the very deep abysmal depths of the shadow of death but it was a process the issue of which was deliverance and life and joy.  He employed this in His last illustration to His disciples and to His Church.</span></p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 96pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span><img width="20" height="12" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4873.gif"/></span>   <span class="s43">PARABLES AND METAPHORS OF OUK LOKD</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="5" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4874.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4875.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="8" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4876.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The reference of course is a wonderful one. One cannot read it without  the  mind  sweeping  back  over  the  Bible  to  the  appalling mystery of evil in its genesis in human experience.  We remember words spoken there by Jehovah to the woman.    Unto the woman He said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception  in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children,” That is the first gleam of evangelical light that shines when sin had entered, when God had whispered, shall we dare to say, into the heart of motherhood the secret of the way of ransom and redemption through suffering, through sorrow  but out of the suffering and sorrow children, new life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="53" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4877.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="34" height="10" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4878.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 93pt;text-indent: 16pt;text-align: justify;">It is interesting to see how this figure is employed in the Old Testa- ment more than once.

He used the very word for child-birth, the begin- ning of travail.

To you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer in His behalf.”  Or listen to Paul again, in his self-same letter to the Philippians, when he expressed the deep passion of his own heart,  That I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.” The inevitability of sorrows for Christ <span><img width="50" height="11" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4889.png"/></span> and it was    by the way of His sorrows that He came to the way of His joy.

Paul was starting out on a missionary journey, and there we have the account of how he came to Antioch in Pisidia.  A wonderful work was done there, but persecu- tion arose. He had to flee, and he came to Iconium. There was wonderful work done until enemies came down, and he had to leave Iconium and he went to Lystra.  Enemies followed him there again. It was a wonderful time at Lystra.  There he probably found Timothy. But his enemies came there also, and nearly caught him.  They cast him out and rained stones on him and left him for dead.  I can see him lying there for the time being, bruised, bloody, and broken, left for dead. Then something happened. What was it   Read for your- selves.  He was not dead  Presently he gathered himself up, that broken body. What did he do   Did he try to get away from it all, and go farther afield   No, he turned back, and he went back to Lystra, the place where they had stoned him, and then on back to Iconium, and to Antioch in Pisidia from where he had to flee.  What did he go back for   He went back to strengthen the Churches, and to show them that what he had been suffering was not against but for the Kingdom of God.  He went back to show them, as Luke says,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4898.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: right;">That through many tribulations we must enter into the Kingdom</p><p style="padding-left: 75pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">of God,” that the sorrows were the very means of bringing life.  Paul was sharing in the birth-pangs out of which new life came.  That is but an illustration, but these two chapters tell the whole fascinating story, and grip the soul as a revelation of what Jesus was here teaching His disciples.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="6" height="4" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4899.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="2" height="9" alt="image" src="The-Parables-and-Metaphors-of-Our-Lord_files/Image_4900.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Yes, we have our sorrows, but   your sorrow shall be turned into joy.”  He was not promising them compensation for suffering, that they would have suffering now, and must bear it.  They will give you such joy presently, that the sorrows will be forgotten. That is not what He said.  He said these sorrows shall be transmuted, turned into joy.  The woman when she is in travail knows bitterness and sorrow and anguish  but afterwards she forgets the anguish and sorrow because of the child she holds in her arms, the life won out of death.

Or someone has lost everything, and they say, We are Christians ; we must all bear the cross.  That is not the cross. We have never touched the cross so long as our suffering is purely personal.
