# 问候
1. 基督耶稣的仆人保罗和提摩太写信给凡住腓立比、在基督耶稣里的众圣徒,和诸位监督,诸位执事。 
2. 愿恩惠、平安从　神我们的父并主耶稣基督归与你们！
# 保罗为腓立比信徒祷告
3. 我每逢想念你们,就感谢我的　神； 
4. 每逢为你们众人祈求的时候,常是欢欢喜喜地祈求。 
5. 因为从头一天直到如今,你们是同心合意地兴旺福音。 
6. 我深信那在你们心里动了善工的,必成全这工,直到耶稣基督的日子。 
7. 我为你们众人有这样的意念,原是应当的；因你们常在我心里,无论我是在捆锁之中,是辩明证实福音的时候,你们都与我一同得恩。 
8. 我体会基督耶稣的心肠,切切地想念你们众人；这是　神可以给我作见证的。 
9. 我所祷告的,就是要你们的爱心在知识和各样见识上多而又多, 
10. 使你们能分别是非（或作“喜爱那美好的事”）,作诚实无过的人,直到基督的日子； 
11. 并靠着耶稣基督结满了仁义的果子,叫荣耀称赞归与　神。
# 我活着就是基督
12. 弟兄们,我愿意你们知道,我所遭遇的事更是叫福音兴旺, 
13. 以致我受的捆锁在御营全军和其余的人中,已经显明是为基督的缘故。 
14. 并且那在主里的弟兄多半因我受的捆锁就笃信不疑,越发放胆传　神的道,无所惧怕。
15. 有的传基督是出于嫉妒纷争,也有的是出于好意。 16这一等是出于爱心,知道我是为辩明福音设立的； 17那一等传基督是出于结党,并不诚实,意思要加增我捆锁的苦楚。 18这有何妨呢？或是假意,或是真心,无论怎样,基督究竟被传开了。为此,我就欢喜,并且还要欢喜； 19因为我知道,这事藉着你们的祈祷和耶稣基督之灵的帮助,终必叫我得救。 20照着我所切慕、所盼望的,没有一事叫我羞愧。只要凡事放胆,无论是生是死,总叫基督在我身上照常显大。 21因我活着就是基督,我死了就有益处。 22但我在肉身活着,若成就我工夫的果子,我就不知道该挑选什么。 23我正在两难之间,情愿离世与基督同在,因为这是好得无比的。 24然而,我在肉身活着,为你们更是要紧的。 25我既然这样深信,就知道仍要住在世间,且与你们众人同住,使你们在所信的道上又长进又喜乐, 26叫你们在基督耶稣里的欢乐,因我再到你们那里去,就越发加增。
27只要你们行事为人与基督的福音相称,叫我或来见你们,或不在你们那里,可以听见你们的景况,知道你们同有一个心志,站立得稳,为所信的福音齐心努力。 28凡事不怕敌人的惊吓,这是证明他们沉沦,你们得救都是出于　神。 29因为你们蒙恩,不但得以信服基督,并要为他受苦。 30你们的争战,就与你们在我身上从前所看见、现在所听见的一样。

# Greetings from Paul
1. This letter is from Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus.
I am writing to all of God's holy people in Philippi who belong to Christ Jesus, including the church leaders and deacons.
2. May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
# Paul's Thanksgiving and Prayer
3. Every time I think of you, I give thanks to my God. 
4. Whenever I pray, I make my requests for all of you with joy, 
5. for you have been my partners in spreading the Good News about Christ from the time you first heard it until now. 
6. And I am certain that God, who began the good work within you, will continue his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns.
7. So it is right that I should feel as I do about all of you, for you have a special place in my heart. You share with me the special favor of God, both in my imprisonment and in defending and confirming the truth of the Good News. 
8. God knows how much I love you and long for you with the tender compassion of Christ Jesus.
9. I pray that your love will overflow more and more, and that you will keep on growing in knowledge and understanding.
10. For I want you to understand what really matters, so that you may live pure and blameless lives until the day of Christ's return. 
11. May you always be filled with the fruit of your salvation—the righteous character produced in your life by Jesus Christ—for this will bring much glory and praise to God.
# Paul's Joy That Christ Is Preached
12And I want you to know, my dear brothers and sisters, that everything that has happened to me here has helped to spread the Good News. 13For everyone here, including the whole palace guard, knows that I am in chains because of Christ. 14And because of my imprisonment, most of the believers here have gained confidence and boldly speak God's message without fear.
15It's true that some are preaching out of jealousy and rivalry. But others preach about Christ with pure motives. 16They preach because they love me, for they know I have been appointed to defend the Good News. 17Those others do not have pure motives as they preach about Christ. They preach with selfish ambition, not sincerely, intending to make my chains more painful to me. 18But that doesn't matter. Whether their motives are false or genuine, the message about Christ is being preached either way, so I rejoice. And I will continue to rejoice. 19For I know that as you pray for me and the Spirit of Jesus Christ helps me, this will lead to my deliverance.
# Paul's Life for Christ
20For I fully expect and hope that I will never be ashamed, but that I will continue to be bold for Christ, as I have been in the past. And I trust that my life will bring honor to Christ, whether I live or die. 21For to me, living means living for Christ, and dying is even better. 22But if I live, I can do more fruitful work for Christ. So I really don't know which is better. 23I'm torn between two desires: I long to go and be with Christ, which would be far better for me. 24But for your sakes, it is better that I continue to live.
25Knowing this, I am convinced that I will remain alive so I can continue to help all of you grow and experience the joy of your faith. 26And when I come to you again, you will have even more reason to take pride in Christ Jesus because of what he is doing through me.
# Live as Citizens of Heaven
27Above all, you must live as citizens of heaven, conducting yourselves in a manner worthy of the Good News about Christ. Then, whether I come and see you again or only hear about you, I will know that you are standing together with one spirit and one purpose, fighting together for the faith, which is the Good News. 28Don't be intimidated in any way by your enemies. This will be a sign to them that they are going to be destroyed, but that you are going to be saved, even by God himself. 29For you have been given not only the privilege of trusting in Christ but also the privilege of suffering for him. 30We are in this struggle together. You have seen my struggle in the past, and you know that I am still in the midst of it.

# 以基督的心为心
1所以,在基督里若有什么劝勉,爱心有什么安慰,圣灵有什么交通,心中有什么慈悲怜悯, 2你们就要意念相同,爱心相同,有一样的心思,有一样的意念,使我的喜乐可以满足。 3凡事不可结党,不可贪图虚浮的荣耀；只要存心谦卑,各人看别人比自己强。 4各人不要单顾自己的事,也要顾别人的事。
5你们当以基督耶稣的心为心。
6他本有　神的形像,
不以自己与　神同等为强夺的；
7反倒虚己,
取了奴仆的形像,
成为人的样式；
8既有人的样子,就自己卑微,
存心顺服,以至于死,
且死在十字架上。
9所以,　神将他升为至高,
又赐给他那超乎万名之上的名,
10叫一切在天上的、地上的,和地底下的,
因耶稣的名无不屈膝,
11无不口称“耶稣基督为主”,
使荣耀归与父　神。
# 在这世上像明光照耀
12这样看来,我亲爱的弟兄,你们既是常顺服的,不但我在你们那里,就是我如今不在你们那里,更是顺服的,就当恐惧战兢做成你们得救的工夫。 13因为你们立志行事都是　神在你们心里运行,为要成就他的美意。 14凡所行的,都不要发怨言,起争论, 15使你们无可指摘,诚实无伪,在这弯曲悖谬的世代作　神无瑕疵的儿女。你们显在这世代中,好像明光照耀, 16将生命的道表明出来,叫我在基督的日子好夸我没有空跑,也没有徒劳。 17我以你们的信心为供献的祭物,我若被浇奠在其上,也是喜乐,并且与你们众人一同喜乐。 18你们也要照样喜乐,并且与我一同喜乐。
# 提摩太和以巴弗提
19我靠主耶稣指望快打发提摩太去见你们,叫我知道你们的事,心里就得着安慰。 20因为我没有别人与我同心,实在挂念你们的事。 21别人都求自己的事,并不求耶稣基督的事。 22但你们知道提摩太的明证；他兴旺福音,与我同劳,待我像儿子待父亲一样。 23所以,我一看出我的事要怎样了结,就盼望立刻打发他去； 24但我靠着主自信我也必快去。
25然而,我想必须打发以巴弗提到你们那里去。他是我的兄弟,与我一同做工,一同当兵,是你们所差遣的,也是供给我需用的。 26他很想念你们众人,并且极其难过,因为你们听见他病了。 27他实在是病了,几乎要死；然而　神怜恤他,不但怜恤他,也怜恤我,免得我忧上加忧。 28所以我越发急速打发他去,叫你们再见他,就可以喜乐,我也可以少些忧愁。 29故此,你们要在主里欢欢乐乐地接待他,而且要尊重这样的人； 30因他为做基督的工夫,几乎至死,不顾性命,要补足你们供给我的不及之处。

# Have the Attitude of Christ
1Is there any encouragement from belonging to Christ? Any comfort from his love? Any fellowship together in the Spirit? Are your hearts tender and compassionate? 2Then make me truly happy by agreeing wholeheartedly with each other, loving one another, and working together with one mind and purpose.
3Don't be selfish; don't try to impress others. Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourselves. 4Don't look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others, too.
5You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had.

6Though he was God,
he did not think of equality with God
as something to cling to.
7Instead, he gave up his divine privileges;
he took the humble position of a slave
and was born as a human being.
When he appeared in human form,
8he humbled himself in obedience to God
and died a criminal's death on a cross.

9Therefore, God elevated him to the place of highest honor
and gave him the name above all other names,
10that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
11and every tongue declare that Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father.
# Shine Brightly for Christ
12Dear friends, you always followed my instructions when I was with you. And now that I am away, it is even more important. Work hard to show the results of your salvation, obeying God with deep reverence and fear. 13For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him.
14Do everything without complaining and arguing, 15so that no one can criticize you. Live clean, innocent lives as children of God, shining like bright lights in a world full of crooked and perverse people. 16Hold firmly to the word of life; then, on the day of Christ's return, I will be proud that I did not run the race in vain and that my work was not useless. 17But I will rejoice even if I lose my life, pouring it out like a liquid offering to God, just like your faithful service is an offering to God. And I want all of you to share that joy. 18Yes, you should rejoice, and I will share your joy.
# Paul Commends Timothy
19If the Lord Jesus is willing, I hope to send Timothy to you soon for a visit. Then he can cheer me up by telling me how you are getting along. 20I have no one else like Timothy, who genuinely cares about your welfare. 21All the others care only for themselves and not for what matters to Jesus Christ. 22But you know how Timothy has proved himself. Like a son with his father, he has served with me in preaching the Good News. 23I hope to send him to you just as soon as I find out what is going to happen to me here. 24And I have confidence from the Lord that I myself will come to see you soon.
# Paul Commends Epaphroditus
25Meanwhile, I thought I should send Epaphroditus back to you. He is a true brother, co-worker, and fellow soldier. And he was your messenger to help me in my need. 26I am sending him because he has been longing to see you, and he was very distressed that you heard he was ill. 27And he certainly was ill; in fact, he almost died. But God had mercy on him—and also on me, so that I would not have one sorrow after another.
28So I am all the more anxious to send him back to you, for I know you will be glad to see him, and then I will not be so worried about you. 29Welcome him in the Lord's love and with great joy, and give him the honor that people like him deserve. 30For he risked his life for the work of Christ, and he was at the point of death while doing for me what you couldn't do from far away.


# 真正的义
1弟兄们,我还有话说,你们要靠主喜乐。我把这话再写给你们,于我并不为难,于你们却是妥当。 2应当防备犬类,防备作恶的,防备妄自行割的。 3因为真受割礼的,乃是我们这以　神的灵敬拜、在基督耶稣里夸口、不靠着肉体的。 4其实,我也可以靠肉体；若是别人想他可以靠肉体,我更可以靠着了。 5我第八天受割礼；我是以色列族、便雅悯支派的人,是希伯来人所生的希伯来人。就律法说,我是法利赛人； 6就热心说,我是逼迫教会的；就律法上的义说,我是无可指摘的。 7只是我先前以为与我有益的,我现在因基督都当作有损的。 8不但如此,我也将万事当作有损的,因我以认识我主基督耶稣为至宝。我为他已经丢弃万事,看作粪土,为要得着基督； 9并且得以在他里面,不是有自己因律法而得的义,乃是有信基督的义,就是因信　神而来的义, 10使我认识基督,晓得他复活的大能,并且晓得和他一同受苦,效法他的死, 11或者我也得以从死里复活。
# 向着标竿直跑
12这不是说我已经得着了,已经完全了；我乃是竭力追求,或者可以得着基督耶稣所以得着我的（“所以得着我的或作“所要我得的）。 13弟兄们,我不是以为自己已经得着了；我只有一件事,就是忘记背后,努力面前的, 14向着标竿直跑,要得　神在基督耶稣里从上面召我来得的奖赏。 15所以我们中间,凡是完全人总要存这样的心；若在什么事上存别样的心,　神也必以此指示你们。 16然而,我们到了什么地步,就当照着什么地步行。
17弟兄们,你们要一同效法我,也当留意看那些照我们榜样行的人。 18因为有许多人行事是基督十字架的仇敌。我屡次告诉你们,现在又流泪地告诉你们： 19他们的结局就是沉沦；他们的神就是自己的肚腹。他们以自己的羞辱为荣耀,专以地上的事为念。 20我们却是天上的国民,并且等候救主,就是主耶稣基督从天上降临。 21他要按着那能叫万有归服自己的大能,将我们这卑贱的身体改变形状,和他自己荣耀的身体相似。

# The Priceless Value of Knowing Christ
1Whatever happens, my dear brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord. I never get tired of telling you these things, and I do it to safeguard your faith.
2Watch out for those dogs, those people who do evil, those mutilators who say you must be circumcised to be saved. 3For we who worship by the Spirit of God are the ones who are truly circumcised. We rely on what Christ Jesus has done for us. We put no confidence in human effort, 4though I could have confidence in my own effort if anyone could. Indeed, if others have reason for confidence in their own efforts, I have even more!
5I was circumcised when I was eight days old. I am a pure-blooded citizen of Israel and a member of the tribe of Benjamin—a real Hebrew if there ever was one! I was a member of the Pharisees, who demand the strictest obedience to the Jewish law. 6I was so zealous that I harshly persecuted the church. And as for righteousness, I obeyed the law without fault.
7I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done. 8Yes, everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have discarded everything else, counting it all as garbage, so that I could gain Christ 9and become one with him. I no longer count on my own righteousness through obeying the law; rather, I become righteous through faith in Christ. For God's way of making us right with himself depends on faith. 10I want to know Christ and experience the mighty power that raised him from the dead. I want to suffer with him, sharing in his death, 11so that one way or another I will experience the resurrection from the dead!
# Pressing toward the Goal
12I don't mean to say that I have already achieved these things or that I have already reached perfection. But I press on to possess that perfection for which Christ Jesus first possessed me. 13No, dear brothers and sisters, I have not achieved it, but I focus on this one thing: Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead, 14I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize for which God, through Christ Jesus, is calling us.
15Let all who are spiritually mature agree on these things. If you disagree on some point, I believe God will make it plain to you. 16But we must hold on to the progress we have already made.
17Dear brothers and sisters, pattern your lives after mine, and learn from those who follow our example. 18For I have told you often before, and I say it again with tears in my eyes, that there are many whose conduct shows they are really enemies of the cross of Christ. 19They are headed for destruction. Their god is their appetite, they brag about shameful things, and they think only about this life here on earth. 20But we are citizens of heaven, where the Lord Jesus Christ lives. And we are eagerly waiting for him to return as our Savior. 21He will take our weak mortal bodies and change them into glorious bodies like his own, using the same power with which he will bring everything under his control.

1我所亲爱、所想念的弟兄们,你们就是我的喜乐,我的冠冕。我亲爱的弟兄,你们应当靠主站立得稳。
# 保罗的劝导
2我劝友阿爹和循都基,要在主里同心。 3我也求你这真实同负一轭的,帮助这两个女人,因为她们在福音上曾与我一同劳苦；还有革利免,并其余和我一同做工的,他们的名字都在生命册上。 4你们要靠主常常喜乐。我再说,你们要喜乐。 5当叫众人知道你们谦让的心。主已经近了。 6应当一无挂虑,只要凡事藉着祷告、祈求,和感谢,将你们所要的告诉　神。 7　神所赐出人意外的平安,必在基督耶稣里保守你们的心怀意念。
8弟兄们,我还有未尽的话：凡是真实的、可敬的、公义的、清洁的、可爱的、有美名的,若有什么德行,若有什么称赞,这些事你们都要思念。 9你们在我身上所学习的,所领受的,所听见的,所看见的,这些事你们都要去行,赐平安的　神就必与你们同在。
# 为馈送而致谢
10我靠主大大地喜乐,因为你们思念我的心如今又发生；你们向来就思念我,只是没得机会。 11我并不是因缺乏说这话；我无论在什么景况都可以知足,这是我已经学会了。 12我知道怎样处卑贱,也知道怎样处丰富；或饱足,或饥饿；或有余,或缺乏,随事随在,我都得了秘诀。 13我靠着那加给我力量的,凡事都能作。 14然而,你们和我同受患难原是美事。 15腓立比人哪,你们也知道我初传福音离了马其顿的时候,论到授受的事,除了你们以外,并没有别的教会供给我。 16就是我在帖撒罗尼迦,你们也一次两次地打发人供给我的需用。 17我并不求什么馈送,所求的就是你们的果子渐渐增多,归在你们的账上。 18但我样样都有,并且有余。我已经充足,因我从以巴弗提受了你们的馈送,当作极美的香气,为　神所收纳、所喜悦的祭物。 19我的　神必照他荣耀的丰富,在基督耶稣里,使你们一切所需用的都充足。 20愿荣耀归给我们的父　神,直到永永远远。阿们！
# 祝福
21请问在基督耶稣里的各位圣徒安。在我这里的众弟兄都问你们安。 22众圣徒都问你们安。在凯撒家里的人特特地问你们安。 23愿主耶稣基督的恩常在你们心里！

## 1Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stay true to the Lord. I love you and long to see you, dear friends, for you are my joy and the crown I receive for my work.

# Words of Encouragement
2Now I appeal to Euodia and Syntyche. Please, because you belong to the Lord, settle your disagreement. 3And I ask you, my true partner, to help these two women, for they worked hard with me in telling others the Good News. They worked along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are written in the Book of Life.
4Always be full of joy in the Lord. I say it again—rejoice! 5Let everyone see that you are considerate in all you do. Remember, the Lord is coming soon.
6Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. 7Then you will experience God's peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.
8And now, dear brothers and sisters, one final thing. Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise. 9Keep putting into practice all you learned and received from me—everything you heard from me and saw me doing. Then the God of peace will be with you.
# Paul's Thanks for Their Gifts
10How I praise the Lord that you are concerned about me again. I know you have always been concerned for me, but you didn't have the chance to help me. 11Not that I was ever in need, for I have learned how to be content with whatever I have. 12I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little. 13For I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength. 14Even so, you have done well to share with me in my present difficulty.
15As you know, you Philippians were the only ones who gave me financial help when I first brought you the Good News and then traveled on from Macedonia. No other church did this. 16Even when I was in Thessalonica you sent help more than once. 17I don't say this because I want a gift from you. Rather, I want you to receive a reward for your kindness.
18At the moment I have all I need—and more! I am generously supplied with the gifts you sent me with Epaphroditus. They are a sweet-smelling sacrifice that is acceptable and pleasing to God. 19And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus.
20Now all glory to God our Father forever and ever! Amen.
# Paul's Final Greetings
21Give my greetings to each of God's holy people—all who belong to Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send you their greetings. 22And all the rest of God's people send you greetings, too, especially those in Caesar's household.
23May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
