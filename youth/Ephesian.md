### Ephesian 

问候

\d. 奉　神旨意,作基督耶稣使徒的保罗和兄弟提摩太
\d. 写信给歌罗西的圣徒,在基督里有忠心的弟兄。愿恩惠、平安从　神我们的父归与你们！
为信徒感谢　神

\d. 我们感谢　神我们主耶稣基督的父,常常为你们祷告； 
\d. 因听见你们在基督耶稣里的信心,并向众圣徒的爱心, 
\d. 是为那给你们存在天上的盼望；这盼望就是你们从前在福音真理的道上所听见的。 
\d. 这福音传到你们那里,也传到普天之下,并且结果,增长,如同在你们中间,自从你们听见福音,真知道　神恩惠的日子一样。 
\d. 正如你们从我们所亲爱、一同作仆人的以巴弗所学的。他为我们（有古卷作“你们”）作了基督忠心的执事, 
\d. 也把你们因圣灵所存的爱心告诉了我们。
基督的位格和工作

\d. 因此,我们自从听见的日子,也就为你们不住地祷告祈求,愿你们在一切属灵的智慧悟性上,满心知道　神的旨意； 
\d. 
\d. 好叫你们行事为人对得起主,凡事蒙他喜悦,在一切善事上结果子,渐渐地多知道　神； 
\d. 
\d. 照他荣耀的权能,得以在各样的力上加力,好叫你们凡事欢欢喜喜地忍耐宽容； 
\d. 
\d. 又感谢父,叫我们能与众圣徒在光明中同得基业。 
\d. 
\d. 他救了我们脱离黑暗的权势,把我们迁到他爱子的国里； 
\d. 
\d. 我们在爱子里得蒙救赎,罪过得以赦免。 
\d. 
\d. 爱子是那不能看见之　神的像,是首生的,在一切被造的以先。 
\d. 
\d. 因为万有都是靠他造的,无论是天上的,地上的；能看见的,不能看见的；或是有位的,主治的,执政的,掌权的；一概都是藉着他造的,又是为他造的。 
\d. 
\d. 他在万有之先；万有也靠他而立。 
\d. 
\d. 他也是教会全体之首。他是元始,是从死里首先复生的,使他可以在凡事上居首位。 
\d. 
\d. 因为父喜欢叫一切的丰盛在他里面居住。 
\d. 
\d. 既然藉着他在十字架上所流的血成就了和平,便藉着他叫万有,无论是地上的、天上的,都与自己和好了。

\d. 
\d. 你们从前与　神隔绝,因着恶行,心里与他为敌。 
\d. 
\d. 但如今他藉着基督的肉身受死,叫你们与自己和好,都成了圣洁,没有瑕疵,无可责备,把你们引到自己面前。 
\d. 
\d. 只要你们在所信的道上恒心,根基稳固,坚定不移,不至被引动失去（原文作“离开”）福音的盼望。这福音就是你们所听过的,也是传与普天下万人听的（原文作“凡受造的”）,我保罗也作了这福音的执事。
保罗为教会的工作

\d. 
\d. 现在我为你们受苦,倒觉欢乐；并且为基督的身体,就是为教会,要在我肉身上补满基督患难的缺欠。 
\d. 
\d. 我照　神为你们所赐我的职分作了教会的执事,要把　神的道理传得全备, 
\d. 
\d. 这道理就是历世历代所隐藏的奥秘；但如今向他的圣徒显明了。 
\d. 
\d. 　神愿意叫他们知道,这奥秘在外邦人中有何等丰盛的荣耀,就是基督在你们心里成了有荣耀的盼望。 
\d. 
\d. 我们传扬他,是用诸般的智慧,劝戒各人,教导各人,要把各人在基督里完完全全地引到　神面前。 
\d. 
\d. 我也为此劳苦,照着他在我里面运用的大能尽心竭力。

Greetings from Paul

\d. This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from our brother Timothy.

\d. We are writing to God's holy people in the city of Colosse, who are faithful brothers and sisters in Christ.
May God our Father give you grace and peace.
Paul's Thanksgiving and Prayer

\d. We always pray for you, and we give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
\d. For we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all of God's people, 
\d. which come from your confident hope of what God has reserved for you in heaven. You have had this expectation ever since you first heard the truth of the Good News.

\d. This same Good News that came to you is going out all over the world. It is bearing fruit everywhere by changing lives, just as it changed your lives from the day you first heard and understood the truth about God's wonderful grace.

\d. You learned about the Good News from Epaphras, our beloved co-worker. He is Christ's faithful servant, and he is helping us on your behalf. 
\d. He has told us about the love for others that the Holy Spirit has given you.

\d. So we have not stopped praying for you since we first heard about you. We ask God to give you complete knowledge of his will and to give you spiritual wisdom and understanding. 
\d. 
\d. Then the way you live will always honor and please the Lord, and your lives will produce every kind of good fruit. All the while, you will grow as you learn to know God better and better.

\d. 
\d. We also pray that you will be strengthened with all his glorious power so you will have all the endurance and patience you need. May you be filled with joy, 
\d. 
\d. always thanking the Father. He has enabled you to share in the inheritance that belongs to his people, who live in the light. 
\d. 
\d. For he has rescued us from the kingdom of darkness and transferred us into the Kingdom of his dear Son, 
\d. 
\d. who purchased our freedom and forgave our sins.
Christ Is Supreme

\d. 
\d. Christ is the visible image of the invisible God.
He existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation,

\d. 
\d. for through him God created everything
in the heavenly realms and on earth.
He made the things we can see
and the things we can't see—
such as thrones, kingdoms, rulers, and authorities in the unseen world.
Everything was created through him and for him.

\d. 
\d. He existed before anything else,
and he holds all creation together.

\d. 
\d. Christ is also the head of the church,
which is his body.
He is the beginning,
supreme over all who rise from the dead.
So he is first in everything.

\d. 
\d. For God in all his fullness
was pleased to live in Christ,

\d. 
\d. and through him God reconciled
everything to himself.
He made peace with everything in heaven and on earth
by means of Christ's blood on the cross.


\d. 
\d. This includes you who were once far away from God. You were his enemies, separated from him by your evil thoughts and actions. 
\d. 
\d. Yet now he has reconciled you to himself through the death of Christ in his physical body. As a result, he has brought you into his own presence, and you are holy and blameless as you stand before him without a single fault.

\d. 
\d. But you must continue to believe this truth and stand firmly in it. Don't drift away from the assurance you received when you heard the Good News. The Good News has been preached all over the world, and I, Paul, have been appointed as God's servant to proclaim it.
Paul's Work for the Church

\d. 
\d. I am glad when I suffer for you in my body, for I am participating in the sufferings of Christ that continue for his body, the church. 
\d. 
\d. God has given me the responsibility of serving his church by proclaiming his entire message to you. 
\d. 
\d. This message was kept secret for centuries and generations past, but now it has been revealed to God's people. 
\d. 
\d. For God wanted them to know that the riches and glory of Christ are for you Gentiles, too. And this is the secret: Christ lives in you. This gives you assurance of sharing his glory.

\d. 
\d. So we tell others about Christ, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all the wisdom God has given us. We want to present them to God, perfect in their relationship to Christ. 
\d. 
\d. That's why I work and struggle so hard, depending on Christ's mighty power that works within me.

Thankfulness for Spiritual Attainments

\d. Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,

\d. To the saints and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ who are at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.

\d. We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, 
\d. since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints; 
\d. because of the hope reserved for you in heaven, of which you previously heard in the word of truth, the gospel 
\d. which has come to you, just as in all the world also it is bearing fruit and increasing, even as it has been doing in you also since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth; 
\d. just as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow bond-servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf, 
\d. and he also informed us of your love in the Spirit.

\d. For this reason we also, since the day we heard about it, have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, 
\d. 
\d. so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God; 
\d. 
\d. strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for the attaining of all perseverance and patience; joyously 
\d. 
\d. giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.
The Incomparable Christ

\d. 
\d.  For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son, 
\d. 
\d. in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

\d. 
\d.  He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation: 
\d. 
\d. for by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions, or rulers, or authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him. 
\d. 
\d. He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together. 
\d. 
\d. He is also the head of the body, the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything. 
\d. 
\d. For it was the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him, 
\d. 
\d. and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross.

\d. 
\d. And although you were previously alienated and hostile in attitude, engaged in evil deeds, 
\d. 
\d. yet He has now reconciled you in His body of flesh through death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach— 
\d. 
\d. if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast, and not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, was made a minister.

\d. 
\d. Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am supplementing what is lacking in Christ's afflictions in behalf of His body, which is the church. 
\d. 
\d. I was made a minister of this church according to the commission from God granted to me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the preaching of the word of God, 
\d. 
\d. that is, the mystery which had been hidden from the past ages and generations, but now has been revealed to His saints, 
\d. 
\d. to whom God willed to make known what the wealth of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles is, the mystery that is Christ in you, the hope of glory. 
\d. 
\d. We proclaim Him, admonishing every person and teaching every person with all wisdom, so that we may present every person complete in Christ. 
\d. 
\d. For this purpose I also labor, striving according to His power which works mightily within me.



\d. 我愿意你们晓得,我为你们和老底嘉人,并一切没有与我亲自见面的人,是何等地尽心竭力； 
\d. 要叫他们的心得安慰,因爱心互相联络,以致丰丰足足在悟性中有充足的信心,使他们真知　神的奥秘,就是基督； 
\d. 所积蓄的一切智慧知识,都在他里面藏着。 
\d. 我说这话,免得有人用花言巧语迷惑你们。 
\d. 我身子虽与你们相离,心却与你们同在,见你们循规蹈矩,信基督的心也坚固,我就欢喜了。
基督里生命的丰盛

\d. 你们既然接受了主基督耶稣,就当遵他而行, 
\d. 在他里面生根建造,信心坚固,正如你们所领的教训,感谢的心也更增长了。 
\d. 你们要谨慎,恐怕有人用他的理学和虚空的妄言,不照着基督,乃照人间的遗传和世上的小学就把你们掳去。 
\d. 因为　神本性一切的丰盛都有形有体地居住在基督里面, 
\d. 
\d. 你们在他里面也得了丰盛。他是各样执政掌权者的元首。 
\d. 
\d. 你们在他里面也受了不是人手所行的割礼,乃是基督使你们脱去肉体情欲的割礼。 
\d. 
\d. 你们既受洗与他一同埋葬,也就在此与他一同复活,都因信那叫他从死里复活　神的功用。 
\d. 
\d. 你们从前在过犯和未受割礼的肉体中死了,　神赦免了你们（或作“我们”）一切过犯,便叫你们与基督一同活过来； 
\d. 
\d. 又涂抹了在律例上所写、攻击我们、有碍于我们的字据,把它撤去,钉在十字架上。 
\d. 
\d. 既将一切执政的、掌权的掳来,明显给众人看,就仗着十字架夸胜。

\d. 
\d. 所以,不拘在饮食上,或节期、月朔、安息日都不可让人论断你们。 
\d. 
\d. 这些原是后事的影儿；那形体却是基督。 
\d. 
\d. 不可让人因着故意谦虚和敬拜天使,就夺去你们的奖赏。这等人拘泥在所见过的（有古卷作“这等人窥察所没有见过的”）,随着自己的欲心,无故地自高自大, 
\d. 
\d. 不持定元首。全身既然靠着他,筋节得以相助联络,就因　神大得长进。
基督里的新生活

\d. 
\d. -
\d. 
\d. 你们若是与基督同死,脱离了世上的小学,为什么仍像在世俗中活着、服从那“不可拿、不可尝、不可摸”等类的规条呢？ 
\d. 
\d. 这都是照人所吩咐、所教导的。说到这一切,正用的时候就都败坏了。 
\d. 
\d. 这些规条使人徒有智慧之名,用私意崇拜,自表谦卑,苦待己身,其实在克制肉体的情欲上是毫无功效。

New Living Translation×

\d. I want you to know how much I have agonized for you and for the church at Laodicea, and for many other believers who have never met me personally. 
\d. I want them to be encouraged and knit together by strong ties of love. I want them to have complete confidence that they understand God's mysterious plan, which is Christ himself. 
\d. In him lie hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

\d. I am telling you this so no one will deceive you with well-crafted arguments. 
\d. For though I am far away from you, my heart is with you. And I rejoice that you are living as you should and that your faith in Christ is strong.
Freedom from Rules and New Life in Christ

\d. And now, just as you accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord, you must continue to follow him. 
\d. Let your roots grow down into him, and let your lives be built on him. Then your faith will grow strong in the truth you were taught, and you will overflow with thankfulness.

\d. Don't let anyone capture you with empty philosophies and high-sounding nonsense that come from human thinking and from the spiritual powers of this world, rather than from Christ. 
\d. For in Christ lives all the fullness of God in a human body. 
\d. 
\d. So you also are complete through your union with Christ, who is the head over every ruler and authority.

\d. 
\d. When you came to Christ, you were “circumcised,” but not by a physical procedure. Christ performed a spiritual circumcision—the cutting away of your sinful nature. 
\d. 
\d. For you were buried with Christ when you were baptized. And with him you were raised to new life because you trusted the mighty power of God, who raised Christ from the dead.

\d. 
\d. You were dead because of your sins and because your sinful nature was not yet cut away. Then God made you alive with Christ, for he forgave all our sins. 
\d. 
\d. He canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross. 
\d. 
\d. In this way, he disarmed the spiritual rulers and authorities. He shamed them publicly by his victory over them on the cross.

\d. 
\d. So don't let anyone condemn you for what you eat or drink, or for not celebrating certain holy days or new moon ceremonies or Sabbaths. 
\d. 
\d. For these rules are only shadows of the reality yet to come. And Christ himself is that reality. 
\d. 
\d. Don't let anyone condemn you by insisting on pious self-denial or the worship of angels, saying they have had visions about these things. Their sinful minds have made them proud, 
\d. 
\d. and they are not connected to Christ, the head of the body. For he holds the whole body together with its joints and ligaments, and it grows as God nourishes it.

\d. 
\d. You have died with Christ, and he has set you free from the spiritual powers of this world. So why do you keep on following the rules of the world, such as, 
\d. 
\d. “Don't handle! Don't taste! Don't touch!”? 
\d. 
\d. Such rules are mere human teachings about things that deteriorate as we use them. 
\d. 
\d. These rules may seem wise because they require strong devotion, pious self-denial, and severe bodily discipline. But they provide no help in conquering a person's evil desires.

You Are Built Up in Christ

\d. For I want you to know how great a struggle I have in your behalf and for those who are at Laodicea, and for all those who have not personally seen my face, 
\d. that their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and that they would attain to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ Himself, 
\d. in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 
\d. I say this so that no one will deceive you with persuasive arguments. 
\d. For even though I am absent in body, I am nevertheless with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your orderly manner and the stability of your faith in Christ.

\d. Therefore, as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him, 
\d. having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and established in your faith, just as you were instructed, and overflowing with gratitude.

\d. See to it that there is no one who takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception in accordance with human tradition, in accordance with the elementary principles of the world, rather than in accordance with Christ. 
\d. For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form, 
\d. 
\d. and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over every ruler and authority; 
\d. 
\d. and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision performed without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, 
\d. 
\d. having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead. 
\d. 
\d. And when you were dead in your wrongdoings and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our wrongdoings, 
\d. 
\d. having canceled the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. 
\d. 
\d. When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him.

\d. 
\d. Therefore, no one is to act as your judge in regard to food and drink, or in respect to a festival or a new moon, or a Sabbath day— 
\d. 
\d. things which are only a shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ. 
\d. 
\d. Take care that no one keeps defrauding you of your prize by delighting in humility and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind, 
\d. 
\d. and not holding firmly to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God.

\d. 
\d. If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as, 
\d. 
\d. “Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!” 
\d. 
\d. (which all refer to things destined to perish with use)—in accordance with the commandments and teachings of man? 
\d. 
\d. These are matters which do have the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and humility and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence.




\d. 所以,你们若真与基督一同复活,就当求在上面的事；那里有基督坐在　神的右边。 
\d. 你们要思念上面的事,不要思念地上的事。 
\d. 因为你们已经死了,你们的生命与基督一同藏在　神里面。 
\d. 基督是我们的生命,他显现的时候,你们也要与他一同显现在荣耀里。

\d. 所以,要治死你们在地上的肢体,就如淫乱、污秽、邪情、恶欲,和贪婪,贪婪就与拜偶像一样。 
\d. 因这些事,　神的忿怒必临到那悖逆之子。 
\d. 当你们在这些事中活着的时候,也曾这样行过。 
\d. 但现在你们要弃绝这一切的事,以及恼恨、忿怒、恶毒（或作“阴毒”）、毁谤,并口中污秽的言语。 
\d. 不要彼此说谎；因你们已经脱去旧人和旧人的行为, 
\d. 
\d. 穿上了新人。这新人在知识上渐渐更新,正如造他主的形像。 
\d. 
\d. 在此并不分希腊人、犹太人,受割礼的、未受割礼的,化外人、西古提人,为奴的、自主的,惟有基督是包括一切,又住在各人之内。

\d. 
\d. 所以,你们既是　神的选民,圣洁蒙爱的人,就要存（原文作“穿”。下同）怜悯、恩慈、谦虚、温柔、忍耐的心。 
\d. 
\d. 倘若这人与那人有嫌隙,总要彼此包容,彼此饶恕；主怎样饶恕了你们,你们也要怎样饶恕人。 
\d. 
\d. 在这一切之外,要存着爱心,爱心就是联络全德的。 
\d. 
\d. 又要叫基督的平安在你们心里作主；你们也为此蒙召,归为一体；且要存感谢的心。 
\d. 
\d. 当用各样的智慧,把基督的道理丰丰富富地存在心里（或作“当把基督的道理丰丰富富地存在心里,以各样的智慧”）,用诗章、颂词、灵歌,彼此教导,互相劝戒,心被恩感,歌颂　神。 
\d. 
\d. 无论做什么,或说话或行事,都要奉主耶稣的名,藉着他感谢父　神。
新生活的本分

\d. 
\d. 你们作妻子的,当顺服自己的丈夫,这在主里面是相宜的。 
\d. 
\d. 你们作丈夫的,要爱你们的妻子,不可苦待她们。

\d. 
\d. 你们作儿女的,要凡事听从父母,因为这是主所喜悦的。 
\d. 
\d. 你们作父亲的,不要惹儿女的气,恐怕他们失了志气。

\d. 
\d. 你们作仆人的,要凡事听从你们肉身的主人,不要只在眼前侍奉,像是讨人喜欢的,总要存心诚实敬畏主。 
\d. 
\d. 无论做什么,都要从心里做,像是给主做的,不是给人做的, 
\d. 
\d. 因你们知道从主那里必得着基业为赏赐；你们所侍奉的乃是主基督。 
\d. 
\d. 那行不义的必受不义的报应；主并不偏待人。

Living the New Life

\d. Since you have been raised to new life with Christ, set your sights on the realities of heaven, where Christ sits in the place of honor at God's right hand. 
\d. Think about the things of heaven, not the things of earth. 
\d. For you died to this life, and your real life is hidden with Christ in God. 
\d. And when Christ, who is your life, is revealed to the whole world, you will share in all his glory.

\d. So put to death the sinful, earthly things lurking within you. Have nothing to do with sexual immorality, impurity, lust, and evil desires. Don't be greedy, for a greedy person is an idolater, worshiping the things of this world. 
\d. Because of these sins, the anger of God is coming. 
\d. You used to do these things when your life was still part of this world. 
\d. But now is the time to get rid of anger, rage, malicious behavior, slander, and dirty language. 
\d. Don't lie to each other, for you have stripped off your old sinful nature and all its wicked deeds. 
\d. 
\d. Put on your new nature, and be renewed as you learn to know your Creator and become like him. 
\d. 
\d. In this new life, it doesn't matter if you are a Jew or a Gentile, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbaric, uncivilized, slave, or free. Christ is all that matters, and he lives in all of us.

\d. 
\d. Since God chose you to be the holy people he loves, you must clothe yourselves with tenderhearted mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. 
\d. 
\d. Make allowance for each other's faults, and forgive anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others. 
\d. 
\d. Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds us all together in perfect harmony. 
\d. 
\d. And let the peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts. For as members of one body you are called to live in peace. And always be thankful.

\d. 
\d. Let the message about Christ, in all its richness, fill your lives. Teach and counsel each other with all the wisdom he gives. Sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs to God with thankful hearts. 
\d. 
\d. And whatever you do or say, do it as a representative of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through him to God the Father.
Instructions for Christian Households

\d. 
\d. Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting for those who belong to the Lord.

\d. 
\d. Husbands, love your wives and never treat them harshly.

\d. 
\d. Children, always obey your parents, for this pleases the Lord. 
\d. 
\d. Fathers, do not aggravate your children, or they will become discouraged.

\d. 
\d. Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything you do. Try to please them all the time, not just when they are watching you. Serve them sincerely because of your reverent fear of the Lord. 
\d. 
\d. Work willingly at whatever you do, as though you were working for the Lord rather than for people. 
\d. 
\d. Remember that the Lord will give you an inheritance as your reward, and that the Master you are serving is Christ. 
\d. 
\d. But if you do what is wrong, you will be paid back for the wrong you have done. For God has no favorites.

Put On the New Self

\d. Therefore, if you have been raised with Christ, keep seeking the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 
\d. Set your minds on the things that are above, not on the things that are on earth. 
\d. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. 
\d. When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.

\d. Therefore, treat the parts of your earthly body as dead to sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which amounts to idolatry. 
\d. For it is because of these things that the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience, 
\d. and in them you also once walked, when you were living in them. 
\d. But now you also, rid yourselves of all of them: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene speech from your mouth. 
\d. Do not lie to one another, since you stripped off the old self with its evil practices, 
\d. 
\d. and have put on the new self, which is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created it— 
\d. 
\d. a renewal in which there is no distinction between Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, and free, but Christ is all, and in all.

\d. 
\d. So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience; 
\d. 
\d. bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so must you do also. 
\d. 
\d. In addition to all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity. 
\d. 
\d. Let the peace of Christ, to which you were indeed called in one body, rule in your hearts; and be thankful. 
\d. 
\d. Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God. 
\d. 
\d. Whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father.
Family Relations

\d. 
\d. Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. 
\d. 
\d. Husbands, love your wives and do not become bitter against them. 
\d. 
\d. Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord. 
\d. 
\d. Fathers, do not antagonize your children, so that they will not become discouraged.

\d. 
\d.  Slaves, obey those who are your human masters in everything, not with eye-service, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord. 
\d. 
\d. Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord and not for people, 
\d. 
\d. knowing that it is from the Lord that you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve. 
\d. 
\d. For the one who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done, and that without partiality.

Living as Those Made Alive in Christ

\d. Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 
\d. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. 
\d. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. 
\d. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.

\d. Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. 
\d. Because of these, the wrath of God is coming. 
\d. You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. 
\d. But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. 
\d. Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices 
\d. 
\d. and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator. 
\d. 
\d. Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.

\d. 
\d. Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. 
\d. 
\d. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. 
\d. 
\d. And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.

\d. 
\d. Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. 
\d. 
\d. Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. 
\d. 
\d. And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
Instructions for Christian Households

\d. 
\d. Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.

\d. 
\d. Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.

\d. 
\d. Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.

\d. 
\d. Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged.

\d. 
\d. Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. 
\d. 
\d. Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, 
\d. 
\d. since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving. 
\d. 
\d. Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for their wrongs, and there is no favoritism.

\d. Masters, be just and fair to your slaves. Remember that you also have a Master—in heaven.
An Encouragement for Prayer

\d. Devote yourselves to prayer with an alert mind and a thankful heart. 
\d. Pray for us, too, that God will give us many opportunities to speak about his mysterious plan concerning Christ. That is why I am here in chains. 
\d. Pray that I will proclaim this message as clearly as I should.

\d. Live wisely among those who are not believers, and make the most of every opportunity. 
\d. Let your conversation be gracious and attractive so that you will have the right response for everyone.
Paul's Final Instructions and Greetings

\d. Tychicus will give you a full report about how I am getting along. He is a beloved brother and faithful helper who serves with me in the Lord's work. 
\d. I have sent him to you for this very purpose—to let you know how we are doing and to encourage you. 
\d. I am also sending Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, one of your own people. He and Tychicus will tell you everything that's happening here.

\d. 
\d. Aristarchus, who is in prison with me, sends you his greetings, and so does Mark, Barnabas's cousin. As you were instructed before, make Mark welcome if he comes your way. 
\d. 
\d. Jesus (the one we call Justus) also sends his greetings. These are the only Jewish believers among my co-workers; they are working with me here for the Kingdom of God. And what a comfort they have been!

\d. 
\d. Epaphras, a member of your own fellowship and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings. He always prays earnestly for you, asking God to make you strong and perfect, fully confident that you are following the whole will of God. 
\d. 
\d. I can assure you that he prays hard for you and also for the believers in Laodicea and Hierapolis.

\d. 
\d. Luke, the beloved doctor, sends his greetings, and so does Demas. 
\d. 
\d. Please give my greetings to our brothers and sisters at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church that meets in her house.

\d. 
\d. After you have read this letter, pass it on to the church at Laodicea so they can read it, too. And you should read the letter I wrote to them.

\d. 
\d. And say to Archippus, “Be sure to carry out the ministry the Lord gave you.”

\d. 
\d.  Here is my greeting in my own handwriting—Paul.
Remember my chains.
May God's grace be with you.

\d. Masters, grant your slaves justice and fairness, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.

\d. Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving; 
\d. praying at the same time for us as well, that God will open up to us a door for the word, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I have also been imprisoned; 
\d. that I may make it clear in the way that I ought to proclaim it.

\d.  Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity. 
\d. Your speech must always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person.

\d. As to all my affairs, Tychicus, our beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in the Lord, will bring you information. 
\d. For I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts; 
\d. and with him is Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who is one of your own. They will inform you about the whole situation here.

\d. 
\d. Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; and also Barnabas' cousin Mark (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him); 
\d. 
\d. and also Jesus who is called Justus; these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision, and they have proved to be an encouragement to me. 
\d. 
\d. Epaphras, who is one of your own, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings, always striving earnestly for you in his prayers, that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God. 
\d. 
\d. For I testify for him that he has a deep concern for you and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis. 
\d. 
\d. Luke, the beloved physician, sends you his greetings, and Demas does also. 
\d. 
\d. Greet the brothers and sisters who are in Laodicea and also Nympha and the church that is in her house. 
\d. 
\d. When this letter is read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and you, for your part, read my letter that is coming from Laodicea. 
\d. 
\d. Tell Archippus, “See to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, so that you may fulfill it.”

\d. 
\d.  I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my imprisonment. Grace be with you.
