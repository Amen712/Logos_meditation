# V0.DEV INSTRUCTIONS: ELINDA XIAO'S IMMERSIVE PORTFOLIO

Create a visually breathtaking, animation-rich portfolio website for digital artist Elinda Xiao that pushes creative boundaries while showcasing her work. The site should feel like an interactive art piece itself.

## CORE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
- Create an immersive, gallery-like experience with cutting-edge animations
- Balance artistic expression with intuitive navigation
- Incorporate digital brushstrokes, floating particles, and fluid transitions
- Implement scroll-triggered animations and parallax effects
- Use creative cursor interactions that leave subtle trails or effects

## VISUAL IDENTITY
- **Color Palette**: Deep teal (#1D4E4F), Terracotta pink (#E8A598), Dusty gold (#C4A77D), Off-white (#F9F7F5), Charcoal (#2D2D2D)
- **Typography**: Bold, artistic pairings using "Playfair Display" (serif) for headings with dramatic weight contrasts, "Poppins" (sans-serif) for body, and "Montserrat" for accents
- **Visual Elements**: Incorporate abstract brush strokes, ink splatters, and geometric shapes as decorative elements
- **Textures**: Subtle paper or canvas textures in background elements

## ANIMATION SYSTEM
- Page transitions with morphing shapes or color washes
- Parallax scrolling effects with multiple depth layers
- Text animations that reveal content creatively (letter by letter reveals, fading, sliding)

- Scroll-triggered element appearances with custom easing
- Image galleries with creative transitions between works
