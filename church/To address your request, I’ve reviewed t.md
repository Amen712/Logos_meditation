LangChain (for AI orchestration)
Pinecone (for vector databases)
Autodesk Forge (for CAD integration)
ChatGPT API (for conversational AI) Each slide should feature:
The technology logo.
A short description (e.g., 'LangChain enables seamless AI agent coordination').
A 'Learn More' button linking to the technology's website or documentation. Ensure smooth transitions between slides and mobile responsiveness."
c. Human Expertise Meets AI Section
Purpose: Emphasize the importance of human oversight in AI-driven processes.
v0.dev Prompt:
"Create a section titled 'Human Expertise Meets AI' with a two-column layout:
Left column: Text block with a heading and paragraph explaining how human experts oversee AI outputs for quality and compliance.
Right column: An illustration or image of a human working alongside AI (e.g., an engineer reviewing a design). Use a balanced design with ample white space and a professional tone."
d. Success Stories Section
Purpose: Provide evidence of ROI and efficiency gains through AI implementations.
v0.dev Prompt:
"Design a section called 'Success Stories' with a card layout. Include three cards, each representing a case study with:
A title (e.g., 'Reduced Design Time by 40%').
A brief summary of the project.
Key metrics (e.g., 'Time saved: 20 hours per project', 'Cost reduction: 15%').
A 'Read More' button linking to a detailed case study page. Use a clean, card-based design with subtle shadows and hover effects."
