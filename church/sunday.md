1 　神既在古时藉着众先知多次多方地晓谕列祖， 2 就在这末世藉着他儿子晓谕我们；又早已立他为承受万有的，也曾藉着他创造诸世界。 3 他是　神荣耀所发的光辉，是　神本体的真像，常用他权能的命令托住万有。他洗净了人的罪，就坐在高天至大者的右边。 4 他所承受的名，既比天使的名更尊贵，就远超过天使。

‪约翰福音‬1:1-5,14,16-18 和合本
……
1 太初有道，道与　神同在，道就是　神。 2 这道太初与　神同在。 3 万物是藉着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着他造的。 4 生命在他里头，这生命就是人的光。 5 光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不接受光。……
14 道成了肉身，住在我们中间，充充满满地有恩典有真理。我们也见过他的荣光，正是父独生子的荣光。……16 从他丰满的恩典里，我们都领受了，而且恩上加恩。 17 律法本是藉着摩西传的；恩典和真理都是由耶稣基督来的。 18 从来没有人看见　神，只有在父怀里的独生子将他表明出来。

17 “莫想我来要废掉律法和先知。我来不是要废掉，乃是要成全。 18 我实在告诉你们，就是到天地都废去了，律法的一点一画也不能废去，都要成全。 19 所以，无论何人废掉这诫命中最小的一条，又教训人这样做，他在天国要称为最小的。但无论何人遵行这诫命，又教训人遵行，他在天国要称为大的。 20 我告诉你们，你们的义若不胜于文士和法利赛人的义，断不能进天国。”

丰丰富富的进入神的国
信心。 source, grace and be thankful ( not complain, peaceful because we know God), grace and knowing God

一起关乎生命和敬虔的事。生命， 丰盛人生的品质，虔敬：像神。
用主自己荣耀和美德召我们的主。

1:3-11 和合本
3 　神的神能已将一切关乎生命和虔敬的事赐给我们，皆因我们认识那用自己荣耀和美德召我们的主。 
4 因此，他已将又宝贵又极大的应许赐给我们，叫我们既脱离世上从情欲来的败坏，就得与　神的性情有份。 
5 正因这缘故，你们要分外地殷勤；有了信心，又要加上德行；有了德行，又要加上知识； 
6 有了知识，又要加上节制；有了节制，又要加上忍耐；有了忍耐，又要加上虔敬； 
7 有了虔敬，又要加上爱弟兄的心；有了爱弟兄的心，又要加上爱众人的心。 
8 你们若充充足足地有这几样，就必使你们在认识我们的主耶稣基督上不至于闲懒不结果子了。
9 人若没有这几样，就是眼瞎，只看见近处的，忘了他旧日的罪已经得了洁净。 
10 所以弟兄们，应当更加殷勤，使你们所蒙的恩召和拣选坚定不移。你们若行这几样，就永不失脚； 
11 这样，必叫你们丰丰富富地得以进入我们主救主耶稣基督永远的国。

introduction：
操练敬虔：

大哉，敬虔的奥秘，无人不以为然！就是　神在肉身显现，被圣灵称义（或作“在灵性称义”），被天使看见，被传于外邦，被世人信服，被接在荣耀里。（提摩太前书3:16）

“在敬虔上操练自己。操练身体，益处还少。惟独敬虔，凡事都有益处。因有今生和来生的应许。这话是可信的，是十分可佩服的。我们劳苦努力，正是为此。因我们的指望在乎永生的神。祂是万人的救主，更是信徒的救主。” (提前4:7-10)

我们一定要认识基督（认识父， 自己和这个世界（撒旦））马太福音的五六七。 就是过敬虔生活的原则。是盐和光（基督徒的品格）

使徒保罗常为帖撒罗尼迦教会在三方面的表现和见证祷告并感谢神，在神面前记念他们。这三方面为：
为信心所作的工夫；
因爱心所受的劳苦；
因盼望我们主耶稣基督所存的忍耐（帖前一３）。

这是基督徒所追求的信、望、爱。是基督徒品德的三要素。

你们学了基督，却不是这样。 21 如果你们听过他的道，领了他的教，学了他的真理， 22 就要脱去你们从前行为上的旧人，这旧人是因私欲的迷惑渐渐变坏的； 23 又要将你们的心志改换一新， 24 并且穿上新人；这新人是照着　神的形像造的，有真理的仁义和圣洁。（以弗所4:20-24）



保罗的书信里常提到这三方面，如林前十三13：「如今常存的有信，有望，有爱这三样……。」西一４～５：「……在基督耶稣里的信心，并向众圣徒的爱心，……存在天上的盼望……。」


「因信心所作的工夫」原文为「因信心的工夫」（The Work of Faith）； 信心的工夫亦作信心的工作或信心的行为。

保罗在加拉太书、罗马书里则告诉我们义人因信得生，没有任何人能以凭行律法得救。

我们的得救是本乎恩也因着信－－凭着相信主为我们完成的救恩，相信耶稣基督作我们个人的救主；我们因信就白白称义了（罗三22～23）。

Psalm 119: 11  我将你的话语
诗篇119:11 和合本
11 我将你的话藏在心里，
免得我得罪你。

马太福音4:1-11 和合本
1 当时，耶稣被圣灵引到旷野，受魔鬼的试探。 
2 他禁食四十昼夜，后来就饿了。 
3 那试探人的进前来，对他说：“你若是　神的儿子，可以吩咐这些石头变成食物。” 
4 耶稣却回答说：“经上记着说：‘人活着，不是单靠食物，乃是靠　神口里所出的一切话。’”
5 魔鬼就带他进了圣城，叫他站在殿顶（“顶”原文作“翅”）上， 
6 对他说：“你若是　神的儿子，可以跳下去，因为经上记着说：‘主要为你吩咐他的使者用手托着你，免得你的脚碰在石头上。’”
7 耶稣对他说：“经上又记着说：‘不可试探主你的　神。’” 
8 魔鬼又带他上了一座最高的山，将世上的万国与万国的荣华都指给他看， 
9 对他说：“你若俯伏拜我，我就把这一切都赐给你。” 
10 耶稣说：“撒但（“撒但”就是“抵挡”的意思，乃魔鬼的别名），退去吧！因为经上记着说：‘当拜主你的　神，单要侍奉他。’”
11 于是，魔鬼离了耶稣，有天使来伺候他。

试探和偶像，何为试探： 不顺服；谄媚。荣耀神，犯罪远离神。 耶稣是如何得胜试探。

”你要这样告诉他，耶和华如此说：我所建立的，我必拆毁；我所栽植的，我必拔出；在全地我都如此行。 你为自己图谋大事吗？不要图谋！”

https://bible.com/bible/48/jer.45.4-5.CUNPSS-神
凯勒给出的最后一条建议是“忘记掉你的个人名誉”，他引用了耶利米书45章5节中的一句话：“你为自己图谋大事吗？不要图谋！
”你们当以基督耶稣的心为心： 他本有　神的形象， 不以自己与　神同等为强夺的； 反倒虚己， 取了奴仆的形象， 成为人的样式； 既有人的样子，就自己卑微， 存心顺服，以至于死， 且死在十字架上。 所以，　神将他升为至高， 又赐给他那超乎万名之上的名， 叫一切在天上的、地上的，和地底下的， 因耶稣的名无不屈膝， 无不口称「耶稣基督为主」， 使荣耀归与父　神。“

Psalm 16, 活出爱
冉超智，圣餐。
1John4:7-18
亲爱的我们要彼此相爱，因为爱是从神来的。 凡有爱的都是由神而生，并且认识神。没有爱就不认识神，因为神就是爱。神差他独一的儿子到世上来，使我们藉着他得生命；由此神对我们的爱就显明了。不是我们爱神，而是神爱我们，差他的儿子为我们的罪作了赎罪祭；这就是爱。
